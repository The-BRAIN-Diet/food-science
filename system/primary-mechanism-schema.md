# Primary Mechanism (PM) Schema

## Build Gate Proviso

- Never render or expose spreadsheet letter identifiers in generated content or public-facing pages.
- Always use semantic entity names (for example, `Intervention Dominance`, `Coverage Timing`, `Evidence Type`).
- Treat any letter-identifier wording in generated outputs as a validation failure that must be fixed before build.

This schema defines the canonical data contract for Primary Mechanism pages.
It is derived from the PM specification and enforces one-to-one FM ownership.

## Spreadsheet Interpretation Authority

- Use `system/brs-spreadsheet-schema.md` as the authoritative column-by-column
  interpretation for spreadsheet ingestion.
- When schema structure and spreadsheet interpretation need coordination, do not
  infer; resolve using the spreadsheet schema and generation rules.

## Scope

- Represents a specific intervention-influenceable biological mechanism.
- Contributes to exactly one FM.
- Must remain mechanistic (not FM/system interpretation).

## Section Order (Page Rendering Contract)

1. Definition
2. Mechanistic Basis
3. Dependencies
   - 3.1 KCs (Key Constraints)
   - 3.2 Optional BRSX Modifiers
   - 3.3 Co-factors
4. Dietary Modulation
5. Functional Outputs (Directional Effects)
6. System Integration
7. Key Insight
8. Functional Mechanism Ownership
9. Intervention Dominance
10. Constraints and Failure Modes
11. Notes (Optional)
12. References
13. Missing Entities (only when needed)

## Validation Rules

- `overview` must be <=120 words.
- `functional_mechanism_ownership` must contain exactly one FM (never multiple).
- `dependencies` must not include PM-to-PM dependencies.
- `dependencies.kcs[].type` must be only `substrate` or `precursor`.
- `cofactors` must not include KCs, PMs, foods, or unrelated substances.
- Inputs must be mechanistically justified; no generic food advice entries.
- Foods/substances must exist in system; unresolved entities go to `missing_entities`.
- No scoring formulas or numeric scoring logic allowed.
- No Secondary Mechanisms (SMs) introduced during initial rollout.
- References must resolve to existing citation keys in `static/bibtex/BRAIN-diet.bib`.

## Field Integrity Mapping

- Dependencies -> `dependencies` (KCs + cross-BRS links only)
- Cofactors -> `cofactors` (cofactors only)
- Intervention dominance -> `intervention_dominance.mode`
- Column P -> `functional_mechanism_ownership`

An entity must not appear in more than one of these roles with conflicting meaning.
