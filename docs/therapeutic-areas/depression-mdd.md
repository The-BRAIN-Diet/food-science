## Overview

Depression and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) involve disruption across multiple connected body systems: brain chemical messengers (like serotonin and dopamine), stress hormones, brain inflammation, the way cells produce energy, communication between gut bacteria and the brain, and sleep–wake cycles. Rather than a simple “chemical imbalance,” current science views depression as multiple systems falling out of sync, where problems in one area can trigger problems in others. This helps explain why what we eat, how we sleep, whether we move our bodies, and how much daylight we get can all meaningfully affect mood, because each of these factors influences inflammation, the building blocks for brain chemicals, hormone rhythms, and the brain’s ability to adapt and repair.

Clinical trials and population studies increasingly show that targeted nutrition and lifestyle changes can support recovery alongside conventional treatments. The SMILES trial, a 12-week randomised controlled trial of a modified Mediterranean-style diet in adults with major depression, reported substantially greater symptom improvement and higher remission rates in the dietary support group compared with a social-support control ([Jacka et al., 2017](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5282719/)). A pragmatic primary-care trial of a multi-component lifestyle modification programme that targeted diet quality, physical activity, and sleep also found clinically meaningful reductions in depressive symptoms compared with treatment as usual ([Aguilar-Latorre et al., 2022](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9361711/)). Across Mediterranean-diet and lifestyle trials and large-scale observational analyses, people who follow these plant-forward, minimally processed dietary patterns tend to have a substantially lower risk of developing depression, whereas higher intake of alcohol, ultra-processed foods, and irregular eating patterns such as frequent breakfast skipping are associated with greater depression risk and tend to work against recovery.

The BRAIN Diet ingredients and recipes align with these evidence-supported patterns while adding extra precision for the brain’s specific nutritional needs, focusing on brain chemical production, inflammation control, cellular energy, and gut–brain communication. Rather than replacing medication or therapy, this approach is designed to **work alongside** clinical care by supporting the biological systems that regulate mood and emotional resilience.

## Postnatal Depression: A Distinct but Related Condition

While postnatal depression (PND) falls within the broader depressive spectrum, it is often characterized by a clearer biological trigger profile than most presentations of Major Depressive Disorder. The postpartum period involves rapid hormonal withdrawal, major sleep disruption, immune shifts, and elevated metabolic demand, all of which can destabilize regulatory systems already implicated in depression, including neurotransmission, stress-axis function, inflammatory signalling, and energy metabolism.

For this reason, PND is best understood as a time-linked subtype in which systemic regulatory load is unusually high, rather than simply a contextual variant of standard depression. This distinction has practical implications: in addition to conventional psychological and pharmacological treatments, interventions targeting sleep protection, nutrient sufficiency, metabolic stability, and psychosocial buffering may play a particularly important adjunctive role.

A detailed evidence summary is provided on the dedicated [Postnatal Depression (PND)](/docs/therapeutic-areas/postnatal-depression) page, which outlines epidemiology, mechanisms, screening, and treatment considerations specific to the perinatal period.
