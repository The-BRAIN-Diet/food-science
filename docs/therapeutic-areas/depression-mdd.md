## Overview

Depression and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) share overlapping biological dysfunctions with other neurocognitive conditions, notably chronic inflammation, neurochemical imbalance, mitochondrial impairment, oxidative stress, impaired methylation, gut–brain axis disruption, and glucose dysregulation. Emerging data shows that ADHD is associated with 3 fold occurrences of depression and anxiety, implicating the broader biological dysfunction that this protocol seeks to address (paper.txt, line 141). This is a food-first baseline designed to modulate key biological systems commonly disrupted in ADHD, depression, cognitive decline, and other neurocognitive disorders (paper.txt, line 158).
