## Overview

Depression and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) share overlapping biological dysfunctions with other neurocognitive conditions, notably chronic inflammation, neurochemical imbalance, mitochondrial impairment, oxidative stress, impaired methylation, gut–brain axis disruption, and glucose dysregulation. Emerging data shows that ADHD is associated with 3 fold occurrences of depression and anxiety, implicating the broader biological dysfunction that this protocol seeks to address (paper.txt, line 141). This is a food-first baseline designed to modulate key biological systems commonly disrupted in ADHD, depression, cognitive decline, and other neurocognitive disorders (paper.txt, line 158).

## Neurotransmitter Imbalance

### Serotonin Support

**Serotonin:** Mood regulation, emotional control, impulse moderation. Cofactors: Tryptophan; B6, magnesium; carb co-ingestion to aid LAT1 transport. Food sources: Turkey, eggs, dairy, soy, seeds, oats, bananas. Pair tryptophan-rich proteins with moderate carbs to increase Trp:LNAA ratio; timing midday or evening for calming effect (paper.txt, line 348).

Tryptophan, a serotonin precursor, has been linked to reduced anxiety, improved mood, and lower depressive symptoms (Aquili, 2020a) (paper.txt, line 364).

Serotonin is involved in mood regulation, emotional processing, and impulse control. Reduced levels of serotonin may contribute to the development of ADHD, influencing hyperactive and impulsive components of ADHD but perhaps not inattention (Banerjee and Nandagopal 2015) (paper.txt, line 330).

### Glutamate Dysregulation

Glutamate is the principal excitatory neurotransmitter of the central nervous system and the most abundant neurotransmitter in the brain (Zhou and Danbolt 2014). Dysregulation of glutamatergic signaling has widespread clinical relevance and is strongly implicated in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), including treatment-resistant subtypes (Khoodoruth et al. 2022) (Khoodoruth et al., 2022). Given the limitations of prevailing monoamine hypothesis-based pharmacotherapy, glutamate and glutamatergic-related pathways may offer both alternative and complementary targets for intervention (paper.txt, line 325).

**Glutamate:** Principal excitatory neurotransmitter; learning, memory, cognition and mood deficits. Cofactors: Glutamine (from protein), B6, magnesium, zinc. Food sources: Lentils, poultry, fish, spinach, pumpkin seeds. Maintain magnesium & antioxidant intake to prevent excitotoxicity; balance with GABA-supporting foods in evening (paper.txt, line 345).

Actionable dietary focuses:
- Prioritize protein-rich sources with adequate tryptophan and choline sources (eggs, fish, legumes, soy, seeds)
- Ensure B6, magnesium, and zinc adequacy
- Balance excitatory (glutamate) with inhibitory (GABA) neurotransmitters
- Support glutamatergic balance through dietary phytochemicals such as genistein and omega-3s

### Dopamine Support

**Dopamine:** Attention, motivation, executive function; DMN-to-task switching. Cofactors: Tyrosine, phenylalanine; iron, B6, folate, omega-3s. Food sources: Lean poultry, beef, fish, dairy, soy, pumpkin seeds; omega-3 rich fish. Protein-rich breakfasts; pair with anti-inflammatory nutrients to protect DMN switching; avoid chronic over-reward from ultra-processed foods (paper.txt, line 346).

Actionable dietary focuses:
- Protein-rich breakfasts with tyrosine sources
- Pair with anti-inflammatory nutrients
- Avoid chronic over-reward from ultra-processed foods

## Inflammation and Metabolic Endotoxemia

### LPS-Driven Inflammation

When these weaknesses converge, lipopolysaccharide (LPS, a bacterial endotoxin) crosses into the bloodstream, fueling systemic inflammation, impairing insulin sensitivity (Mohammad and Thiemermann 2021), that inflammation has also been linked to disrupting dopamine and serotonin pathways and causing depression (Batey et al. 2024) (paper.txt, line 511).

Metabolic endotoxemia (ME), defined as chronically elevated circulating lipopolysaccharide (LPS), is very common, while detection is difficult and unreliable, estimates of up to one-third of adults in Western populations are common, particularly those with obesity or high-fat, low-fibre diets. Even modest elevations in LPS can sustain low-grade inflammation, impair insulin sensitivity, and promote neuroinflammatory cascades that compromise dopamine signaling and cognitive resilience (paper.txt, line 511).

### Omega-3 and Inflammation Resolution

In a controlled endotoxemia model (Ferguson et al. 2014), high-dose EPA+DHA (3.6 g/day) attenuated fever and downstream cytokines (IL-6, IL-10), even though TNF-α remained unchanged, suggesting that omega-3s reshape the resolution phase of acute inflammation rather than block its initiation. The endotoxemia model is discussed as an analogue of postprandial inflammation, which is highly relevant as we detail below ADHD is associated with metabolic disorders, and specifically linked to postprandial inflammation (Brown et al. 2025) (paper.txt, line 462).

Actionable dietary focuses:
- Regular EPA/DHA intake (oily fish or algal oil) for anti-inflammatory effects
- Support gut barrier integrity with fiber, polyphenols, and fermented foods
- Reduce ultra-processed foods and high-heat, AGE-rich cooking practices

## Gut-Brain Axis

### Vagal Stimulation

In addition, gut–brain signaling occurs via the vagus nerve, which transmits microbial and neurochemical cues to influence mood and motivation. Vagal stimulation has demonstrated clinical benefits in depression, epilepsy, and inflammation (Austelle et al. 2022) while we detail below preclinical work that shows that gut microbes such as Lactobacillus can alter brain GABA receptor expression through vagal pathways (Bravo et al., 2011) (paper.txt, line 503).

### Psychobiotics

Interventions such as prebiotics, probiotics, high-fibre diets, and fermented foods, collectively referred to in emerging research as psychobiotics (Mohamed and Kobeissy 2024a), have been associated with changes in attentional vigilance and mood regulation (Schmidt et al. 2015) with galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) being linked to reduced anxiety and cortisol (Johnstone et al. 2021) (paper.txt, line 516).

These effects are thought to be, in the main, mediated through increased production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) like butyrate, which support intestinal barrier integrity, regulate immune responses, antioxidant activity (Wang et al. 2022), and promote the synthesis of key neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin (Silva et al. 2020) (paper.txt, line 516).

Actionable dietary focuses:
- Include fermented foods (kimchi, kefir, pickles, sauerkraut) for beneficial bacteria
- Support prebiotic fiber intake (GOS, inulin, pectin) for SCFA production
- Regular consumption of psychobiotic foods

## BDNF and Neuroplasticity

**BDNF (modulator):** Neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, mood resilience. Cofactors: Omega-3s, polyphenols, exercise. Food sources: Fatty fish, blueberries, turmeric, green tea, walnuts. Exercise + omega-3 + polyphenol synergy boosts expression; anti-inflammatory diet helps sustain levels (paper.txt, line 352).

Low levels of BDNF have been associated with various neurodevelopmental disorders, including the polymorphism Val66me which has been linked with lower dopamine and lower BDNF and correlated to anxiety and depression (Hünnerkopf et al. 2007). Knowing one's Val66Met status, via genetic testing, can inform personalized plans for exercise, dietary factors i.e. omega-3s which also can increase BDNF (Ziaei et al. 2024) (paper.txt, line 381).

Actionable dietary focuses:
- Regular omega-3 intake (EPA/DHA)
- Polyphenol-rich foods (blueberries, turmeric, green tea, walnuts)
- Combine with exercise for synergistic BDNF enhancement

## Endocannabinoid System

The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is a key neuromodulatory system that helps regulate dopamine signaling (Covey et al. 2017) and motivation (Laksmidewi and Soejitno 2021), stress response, and inflammation, processes that are often disrupted in ADHD and other neurodevelopmental conditions (paper.txt, line 467).

High plasma levels of AEA have been correlated to psychotic disorders and lower levels to MDD while higher levels have also been associated with ADHD (paper.txt, line 467).

Although omega-3s are not direct endocannabinoids, they contribute to endocannabinoid-like signaling through the production of docosahexaenoyl ethanolamide (DHEA), EPEA (Watson, Kim, and Das 2019), and other N-acyl ethanolamines, and can indirectly affect ECS system. While more research on the endocannabinoid pathways and ADHD is needed, its interactions with dopamine, mood regulation, and inflammation make it a relevant secondary target, particularly in cases of emotional dysregulation or stress sensitivity (paper.txt, line 470).

## Mitochondrial Support

- Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress contribute to depression
- ATP supply depends on micronutrient sufficiency and NAD⁺ availability
- Key compounds: creatine (ATP recycling), CoQ10 (electron transport/antioxidant), taurine (calcium signaling and redox), B vitamins (thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, folate, B12), and magnesium
- Omega-3s support mitochondrial membranes and biogenesis; polyphenol-rich foods bolster endogenous antioxidant networks

Actionable dietary focuses:
- Include oily fish or algal DHA/EPA
- Emphasize polyphenol-dense foods (berries, extra-virgin olive oil, herbs/spices)
- Support B vitamin and magnesium adequacy

## Glucose and Insulin Dynamics

ADHD and some other neuropsychiatric conditions (e.g., ASD, Bipolar and MDD) may represent a cluster of disorders influenced by brain-specific insulin dysregulation (Fanelli et al. 2022) (Fanelli et al., n.d.) (paper.txt, line 780).

Managing glycemic variability stabilizes dopamine–insulin coupling and cognitive performance. Glycemic stabilization is expected to exert downstream effects on emotional regulation through modulation of HPA axis activity, limbic signalling, and neurotransmitter systems (paper.txt, line 335).

Actionable dietary focuses:
- Preserve whole-food structure
- Order meals vegetables → protein/fat → carbohydrate
- Pair carbohydrates with fiber/fat/protein
- Stabilize blood glucose to support mood stability

## Methylation and Homocysteine

Elevated plasma homocysteine, a byproduct of methylation, is frequently elevated in ADHD and other neurodegenerative disorders (Yu et al. 2020), (Luzzi et al. 2022), cognitive impairment, and psychiatric conditions (Lukovac et al. 2024a). Hcy is implicated in the induction of oxidative stress, the modulation of oxygen levels, and the initiation of lipid peroxidation pathway (Lukovac et al. 2024b) (paper.txt, line 482).

B vitamins, particularly B6, B2, folate (5-MTHF), and B12, are essential cofactors in the remethylation of homocysteine (Hcy) to methionine, which is subsequently converted to S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) (paper.txt, line 478).

Actionable dietary focuses:
- Ensure adequate B vitamin intake (B6, B2, folate, B12)
- Support methylation pathways with choline, betaine, and methionine sources
- Address MTHFR polymorphisms if present
