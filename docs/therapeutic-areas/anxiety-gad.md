## Overview

Anxiety and General Anxiety Disorder (GAD) share overlapping biological dysfunctions with other neurocognitive conditions, notably chronic inflammation, neurochemical imbalance, mitochondrial impairment, oxidative stress, impaired methylation, gut–brain axis disruption, and glucose dysregulation. Emerging data shows that ADHD is associated with 3 fold occurrences of depression and anxiety, implicating the broader biological dysfunction that this protocol seeks to address (paper.txt, line 141). Many of the nutritional strategies discussed in this paper—such as glycemic stabilization, SCFA production, polyphenol intake, and anxiolytic probiotic interventions—are expected to exert downstream effects on emotional regulation through modulation of HPA axis activity, limbic signalling, and neurotransmitter systems (paper.txt, line 335).
