## Overview

Anxiety and General Anxiety Disorder (GAD) share overlapping biological dysfunctions with other neurocognitive conditions, notably chronic inflammation, neurochemical imbalance, mitochondrial impairment, oxidative stress, impaired methylation, gut–brain axis disruption, and glucose dysregulation. Emerging data shows that ADHD is associated with 3 fold occurrences of depression and anxiety, implicating the broader biological dysfunction that this protocol seeks to address (paper.txt, line 141). Many of the nutritional strategies discussed in this paper—such as glycemic stabilization, SCFA production, polyphenol intake, and anxiolytic probiotic interventions—are expected to exert downstream effects on emotional regulation through modulation of HPA axis activity, limbic signalling, and neurotransmitter systems (paper.txt, line 335).

## Neurotransmitter Imbalance

### Serotonin Support

**Serotonin:** Mood regulation, emotional control, impulse moderation. Cofactors: Tryptophan; B6, magnesium; carb co-ingestion to aid LAT1 transport. Food sources: Turkey, eggs, dairy, soy, seeds, oats, bananas. Pair tryptophan-rich proteins with moderate carbs to increase Trp:LNAA ratio; timing midday or evening for calming effect (paper.txt, line 348).

Tryptophan, a serotonin precursor, has been linked to reduced anxiety, improved mood, and lower depressive symptoms (Aquili, 2020a) (paper.txt, line 364).

### GABA Support

**GABA:** Main inhibitory neurotransmitter; calms neural activity, supports sleep. Cofactors: Glutamate (from protein), B6, Magnesium functions as an NMDA receptor antagonist and GABA receptor modulator (Clerc et al. 2013), Zinc – acts as an allosteric modulator of the GABA receptor (Peralta and Huidobro-Toro 2016) (paper.txt, line 349).

Levilactobacillus brevis is one of the key bacteria known to produce GABA. It produces GABA through the glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) pathway, where it converts glutamate into GABA (Cataldo et al. 2024). This bacteria is active in L. brevis strains isolated from fermented foods, such as kimchi, kefir, and pickles (paper.txt, line 537).

### Glutamate Balance

**Glutamate:** Principal excitatory neurotransmitter; learning, memory, cognition and mood deficits. Cofactors: Glutamine (from protein), B6, magnesium, zinc. Food sources: Lentils, poultry, fish, spinach, pumpkin seeds. Maintain magnesium & antioxidant intake to prevent excitotoxicity; balance with GABA-supporting foods in evening (paper.txt, line 345).

Actionable dietary focuses:

- Prioritize protein-rich sources with adequate tryptophan and choline sources (eggs, fish, legumes, soy, seeds)
- Ensure B6, magnesium, and zinc adequacy
- Include fermented foods (kimchi, kefir, pickles) for GABA support
- Balance excitatory (glutamate) with inhibitory (GABA) neurotransmitters

## HPA Axis and Stress Response

### Stress Circuitry Dysregulation

The neuroendocrine and autonomic systems, together with the Enteric Nervous System (ENS), form a tightly interwoven network regulating stress responses, metabolism, and gut–brain communication (Mohamed and Kobeissy 2024b). The hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis orchestrates cortisol rhythms and systemic stress signaling, while the autonomic nervous system (ANS) integrates sympathetic "fight-or-flight" activity with parasympathetic recovery pathways (paper.txt, line 769).

Converging evidence indicates that emotion dysregulation is a transdiagnostic construct observed across multiple psychiatric and neurologic conditions. Overlapping fronto-limbic circuitry, stress-axis dynamics, reward/salience signaling, sleep–circadian disruption, and inflammatory tone likely account for the symptom overlap with disorders such as mood and anxiety disorders (paper.txt, line 336).

### Vagal Tone Support

Omega-3s (EPA/DHA) improve vagal tone and HRV control, improving cortisol rhythms and inflammation (Kiecolt-Glaser et al. 2011), BDNF signaling (paper.txt, line 796).

In addition, gut–brain signaling occurs via the vagus nerve, which transmits microbial and neurochemical cues to influence mood and motivation. Vagal stimulation has demonstrated clinical benefits in depression, epilepsy, and inflammation (Austelle et al. 2022) (paper.txt, line 503).

Actionable dietary focuses:

- Regular EPA/DHA intake (oily fish or algal oil) for vagal tone improvement
- Support parasympathetic tone with omega-3s, magnesium, and polyphenols
- Include fermented foods for gut–vagus axis support

## Mitochondrial Support

- Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress contribute to anxiety
- ATP supply depends on micronutrient sufficiency and NAD⁺ availability
- Key compounds: creatine (ATP recycling), CoQ10 (electron transport/antioxidant), taurine (calcium signaling and redox), B vitamins (thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, folate, B12), and magnesium
- Omega-3s support mitochondrial membranes and biogenesis; polyphenol-rich foods bolster endogenous antioxidant networks

Actionable dietary focuses:

- Include oily fish or algal DHA/EPA
- Emphasize polyphenol-dense foods (berries, extra-virgin olive oil, herbs/spices)
- Support B vitamin and magnesium adequacy

## Inflammation

### Chronic Low-Grade Inflammation

Chronic low-grade inflammation and microglial activation impair synaptic plasticity and cognition. Omega-3–derived specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) help resolve inflammation. Dietary patterns aligned with Mediterranean-style eating lower inflammatory load; Western dietary patterns elevate it (paper.txt, line 38-42).

### Gut-Brain Axis and Inflammation

When gut barrier weaknesses converge, lipopolysaccharide (LPS, a bacterial endotoxin) crosses into the bloodstream, fueling systemic inflammation, impairing insulin sensitivity (Mohammad and Thiemermann 2021). That inflammation has also been linked to disrupting dopamine and serotonin pathways (Batey et al. 2024) (paper.txt, line 511).

Actionable dietary focuses:

- Favor fish, olive oil, nuts, legumes, vegetables, fruit, and fermented foods
- Reduce ultra-processed foods and high-heat, AGE-rich cooking practices
- Support gut barrier and microbiome diversity with fiber, polyphenols, and fermented foods

## Glucose and Insulin Dynamics

Managing glycemic variability stabilizes dopamine–insulin coupling and cognitive performance. Glycemic stabilization is expected to exert downstream effects on emotional regulation through modulation of HPA axis activity, limbic signalling, and neurotransmitter systems (paper.txt, line 335).

Actionable dietary focuses:

- Preserve whole-food structure
- Order meals vegetables → protein/fat → carbohydrate
- Pair carbohydrates with fiber/fat/protein
- Stabilize blood glucose to reduce stress responses

## Gut Microbiome and Psychobiotics

### Anxiolytic Probiotic Interventions

Interventions such as prebiotics, probiotics, high-fibre diets, and fermented foods, collectively referred to in emerging research as psychobiotics (Mohamed and Kobeissy 2024a), have been associated with changes in attentional vigilance and mood regulation (Schmidt et al. 2015) with galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) being linked to reduced anxiety and cortisol (Johnstone et al. 2021) (paper.txt, line 516).

These effects are thought to be, in the main, mediated through increased production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) like butyrate, which support intestinal barrier integrity, regulate immune responses, antioxidant activity (Wang et al. 2022), and promote the synthesis of key neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin (Silva et al. 2020) (paper.txt, line 516).

### GABA-Producing Bacteria

Levilactobacillus brevis is one of the key bacteria known to produce GABA. It produces GABA through the glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) pathway, where it converts glutamate into GABA (Cataldo et al. 2024). This bacteria is active in L. brevis strains isolated from fermented foods, such as kimchi, kefir, and pickles (paper.txt, line 537).

Actionable dietary focuses:

- Include fermented foods (kimchi, kefir, pickles, sauerkraut) for GABA-producing bacteria
- Support prebiotic fiber intake (GOS, inulin, pectin) for beneficial bacteria
- Regular consumption of psychobiotic foods

## BDNF and Neuroplasticity

**BDNF (modulator):** Neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, mood resilience. Cofactors: Omega-3s, polyphenols, exercise. Food sources: Fatty fish, blueberries, turmeric, green tea, walnuts. Exercise + omega-3 + polyphenol synergy boosts expression; anti-inflammatory diet helps sustain levels (paper.txt, line 352).

Low levels of BDNF have been associated with various neurodevelopmental disorders, including the polymorphism Val66me which has been linked with lower dopamine and lower BDNF and correlated to anxiety and depression (Hünnerkopf et al. 2007). Knowing one's Val66Met status, via genetic testing, can inform personalized plans for exercise, dietary factors i.e. omega-3s which also can increase BDNF (Ziaei et al. 2024) (paper.txt, line 381).

Actionable dietary focuses:

- Regular omega-3 intake (EPA/DHA)
- Polyphenol-rich foods (blueberries, turmeric, green tea, walnuts)
- Combine with exercise for synergistic BDNF enhancement

## Endocannabinoid System

The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is a key neuromodulatory system that helps regulate dopamine signaling (Covey et al. 2017) and motivation (Laksmidewi and Soejitno 2021), stress response, and inflammation, processes that are often disrupted in ADHD and other neurodevelopmental conditions (paper.txt, line 467).

Although omega-3s are not direct endocannabinoids, they contribute to endocannabinoid-like signaling through the production of docosahexaenoyl ethanolamide (DHEA), EPEA (Watson, Kim, and Das 2019), and other N-acyl ethanolamines, and can indirectly affect ECS system. While more research on the endocannabinoid pathways and ADHD is needed, its interactions with dopamine, mood regulation, and inflammation make it a relevant secondary target, particularly in cases of emotional dysregulation or stress sensitivity (paper.txt, line 470).

## Oxytocin and Social Support

**Oxytocin (modulator):** Social bonding, trust, emotional buffering. Cofactors: Indirect (via gut–vagus axis, social cues). Food sources: Fermented foods, magnesium-rich foods, foods supporting dopamine & serotonin. Mindful shared meals, probiotic-rich foods, stress reduction; benefits from healthy dopamine tone (paper.txt, line 353).

Actionable dietary focuses:

- Include fermented foods for gut–vagus axis support
- Magnesium-rich foods
- Foods supporting dopamine and serotonin
- Mindful shared meals
