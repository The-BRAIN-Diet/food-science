## Overview

ADHD shares overlapping biological dysfunctions with other neurocognitive conditions, notably chronic inflammation, neurochemical imbalance, mitochondrial impairment, oxidative stress, impaired methylation, gut–brain axis disruption, and glucose dysregulation. Dietary strategies that target these systems can improve symptom burden and overall brain–metabolic health.

## Neurotransmitter Imbalance

- Amino acid precursors (tyrosine, tryptophan, choline) support dopamine, serotonin, and acetylcholine synthesis.
- Vitamin B6 (as PLP), magnesium, zinc, and iron act as essential enzymatic cofactors for neurotransmitter pathways; insufficiency impairs synthesis and signaling.
- Preparation methods that reduce antinutrients (soaking/sprouting/fermentation) improve mineral bioavailability and can increase GABA content, supporting inhibitory–excitatory balance.
- Omega-3s (EPA/DHA) improve membrane fluidity and receptor function and modulate neurotransmission.
- Insulin signaling couples to dopamine tone; stabilizing post-prandial glucose supports motivation, attention, and impulse control.

Actionable dietary focuses:

- Prioritize protein-rich, circadian-aligned breakfasts with adequate tyrosine/tryptophan and choline sources (eggs, fish, legumes, soy, seeds).
- Ensure B6, magnesium, zinc, and iron adequacy; pair non-heme iron with vitamin C and use soaking/sprouting to reduce phytates.
- Regular EPA/DHA intake (oily fish or algal oil); consider phospholipid-bound sources for better brain uptake.

## Mitochondrial Support

- Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are common in ADHD; ATP supply depends on micronutrient sufficiency and NAD⁺ availability.
- Key compounds: creatine (ATP recycling), CoQ10 (electron transport/antioxidant), taurine (calcium signaling and redox), B vitamins (thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, folate, B12), and magnesium.
- Omega-3s support mitochondrial membranes and biogenesis; polyphenol-rich foods bolster endogenous antioxidant networks.

Actionable dietary focuses:

- Include oily fish or algal DHA/EPA; organ meats/seafood or plant strategies for CoQ10 and creatine where appropriate; legumes/whole grains plus nuts/seeds for B vitamins and magnesium.
- Emphasize polyphenol-dense foods (berries, extra-virgin olive oil, herbs/spices) and cooking methods that limit AGEs to reduce oxidative burden.

## Inflammation

- Chronic low-grade inflammation and microglial activation impair synaptic plasticity and cognition.
- Omega-3–derived specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) help resolve inflammation.
- Dietary patterns aligned with Mediterranean-style eating lower inflammatory load; Western dietary patterns elevate it.

Actionable dietary focuses:

- Favor fish, olive oil, nuts, legumes, vegetables, fruit, and fermented foods; reduce ultra-processed foods and high-heat, AGE-rich cooking practices.
- Support gut barrier and microbiome diversity with fiber, polyphenols, and fermented foods to decrease systemic inflammation.

## Glucose and Insulin Dynamics

- ADHD is linked with altered brain glucose metabolism and higher cardiometabolic risk.
- Managing glycemic variability stabilizes dopamine–insulin coupling and cognitive performance.

Actionable dietary focuses:

- Preserve whole-food structure; order meals vegetables → protein/fat → carbohydrate; pair carbohydrates with fiber/fat/protein; consider CGM-guided personalization where available.

## Omega-3s (Cross-Cutting)

- Omega-3s (EPA/DHA) benefit membrane fluidity, receptor signaling, mitochondrial function, and pro-resolving inflammatory pathways relevant across ADHD and other neurocognitive conditions.
- Sources and forms:
  - Whole-food: oily fish (salmon, sardine, mackerel, herring), shellfish; plant ALA (flax/chia/walnut) has limited conversion to DHA.
  - Supplements: fish oil or algal oil (vegan) in triglyceride or re-esterified TG forms; ethyl ester forms should be taken with a fat-containing meal for absorption.
  - Phospholipid-bound omega-3s (e.g., krill oil, fish roe) may enhance brain delivery; lysophosphatidylcholine-DHA is a known transport species to the brain.
- Cofactors and synergy:
  - Choline and phosphatidylcholine support acetylcholine synthesis and membrane phospholipid remodeling, which can complement DHA incorporation.
  - Antioxidants (vitamin E, polyphenols) protect highly unsaturated DHA in membranes and in circulation.
  - B vitamins (B6, folate, B12) and minerals (magnesium, zinc, iron) support neurotransmitter and mitochondrial pathways that interact with omega-3 biology.
- Practical guidance:
  - Aim for regular EPA/DHA intake via fish or algal oil; consider phospholipid-bound options when brain uptake is a priority.
  - For individuals with higher inflammatory tone, emphasize EPA; for membrane and neurodevelopmental support, ensure adequate DHA.
  - Take with meals containing fat; store oils away from heat/light and prefer products with third-party oxidation testing.
