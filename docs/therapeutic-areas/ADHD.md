## Overview

ADHD shares overlapping biological dysfunctions with other neurocognitive conditions, notably chronic inflammation, neurochemical imbalance, mitochondrial impairment, oxidative stress, impaired methylation, gut–brain axis disruption, and glucose dysregulation. Dietary strategies that target these systems can improve symptom burden and overall brain–metabolic health.
