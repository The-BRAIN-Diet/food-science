## Overview

Bipolar disorder shares core pathophysiology with other neurocognitive conditions: neurotransmitter imbalance, mitochondrial dysfunction with oxidative stress, and chronic inflammation. Nutrition can modulate these interconnected systems to support mood stability and cognitive function.

## Neurotransmitter Imbalance

- Adequate precursors (tyrosine/tryptophan/choline) and cofactors (B6, zinc, iron, magnesium) support synthesis and conversion of dopamine, serotonin, and GABA.
- Omega-3 fatty acids enhance membrane fluidity and receptor signaling relevant to mood regulation.
- Stable glucose–insulin dynamics help maintain dopaminergic and serotonergic balance.

Actionable dietary focuses:

- Protein distribution across meals; ensure B6, iron, zinc, and magnesium sufficiency via diverse whole-food sources.
- Regular EPA/DHA intake (oily fish; algal oil for plant-based).
- Glycemic moderation through whole-food structure, fiber, and meal sequencing.

## Mitochondrial Support

- Evidence links bipolar disorder to impaired mitochondrial energetics, redox imbalance, and shortened telomeres.
- Nutrients supporting ATP generation and mitochondrial integrity: creatine, CoQ10, taurine, B vitamins (especially thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, folate, B12), magnesium, and omega-3s.
- Trace lithium has been associated with mitochondrial and genomic stability pathways in bipolar populations.

Actionable dietary focuses:

- Include nutrient-dense animal and/or plant strategies to cover creatine/CoQ10/taurine and B vitamins; consider seafood or algal DHA/EPA.
- Polyphenol-rich patterns (berries, olives/olive oil, herbs/spices) to enhance endogenous antioxidant networks.

## Inflammation

- Inflammatory signaling contributes to mood episode vulnerability and neuroprogression.
- Omega-3–derived SPMs facilitate resolution of neuroinflammation; Mediterranean-aligned dietary patterns reduce inflammatory burden.

Actionable dietary focuses:

- Emphasize vegetables, legumes, fruit, whole grains, nuts, olive oil, and fermented foods; reduce ultra-processed foods and excessive high-heat cooking that increases AGEs.
- Support gut–brain axis through fiber diversity and fermented foods to reduce systemic inflammation.

## Omega-3s (Cross-Cutting)

- Omega-3s (EPA/DHA) support membrane dynamics, neurotransmission, mitochondrial function, and inflammatory resolution pathways relevant to mood stability.
- Sources and forms:
  - Whole-food: oily fish (salmon, sardine, mackerel, herring), shellfish; plant ALA (flax/chia/walnut) has limited conversion to DHA.
  - Supplements: fish oil or algal oil in triglyceride or re-esterified TG forms; ethyl ester forms should be taken with a fat-containing meal for absorption.
  - Phospholipid-bound omega-3s (e.g., krill oil, fish roe) may enhance brain delivery; lysophosphatidylcholine-DHA is a known transport species to the brain.
- Cofactors and synergy:
  - Choline and phosphatidylcholine facilitate membrane phospholipid remodeling and may complement DHA incorporation.
  - Antioxidants (vitamin E, polyphenols) help protect DHA from peroxidation in membranes and circulation.
  - B vitamins and magnesium support mitochondrial and neurotransmitter pathways interacting with omega-3 biology.
- Practical guidance:
  - Maintain regular EPA/DHA intake via fish or algal oil; consider phospholipid-bound options when brain uptake is a priority.
  - In higher inflammatory states, consider higher EPA balance; ensure adequate DHA for membrane support.
  - Take with meals containing fat; prefer products with third-party testing and proper storage to limit oxidation.
