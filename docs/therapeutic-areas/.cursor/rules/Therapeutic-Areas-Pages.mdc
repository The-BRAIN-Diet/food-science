description: Format of a Therapeutic Area Page
globs: *.md

- Tag each food page with the substances it contains
- Tag the page with "Therapeutic Area" too, so that it appears in index.md.
- Tag each page with the name of the therapeutic area (e.g. ADHD) so we can refer to it from a biological target.
- Tag each page with the relevant biological targets, so we can refer back to it from the biological targets pages.
- In the front matter, list_image: /img/icons/therapeutic-areas.svg

The Format of the page should have this structure:

- Overview: A single paragraph description describing food, where it comes from, main health benefits etc.
- Biological Targets: Use the <TagList tag="therapeutic area" filter="biological-targets" /> here.

Use the `ADHD.md` page as an example.
