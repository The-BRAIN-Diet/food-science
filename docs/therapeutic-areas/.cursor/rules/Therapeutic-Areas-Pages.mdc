description: Format of a Therapeutic Area Page

- Tag each therapeutic area page with the relevant biological targets so they can be discovered from the biological-target pages.
- Tag the page with "Therapeutic Area" too, so that it appears in index.md.
- Tag each page with the name of the therapeutic area (e.g. ADHD) so we can refer to it from a biological target.
- In the front matter, list_image: /img/icons/therapeutic-areas.svg

The Format of the page should have this structure:

- Overview: A single paragraph describing the therapeutic area, how it manifests biologically, and the high-level nutritional levers (cite paper.txt where relevant).
- Biological Target Matrix: Use `<TherapeuticAreaMatrix tag="Therapeutic Area Name" />` (this component mirrors the recipe matrix but for the therapeutic area → biological targets → substances → foods chain). If this component is not yet available, render `<TagList tag="Therapeutic Area Name" filter="biological-targets" />` as a placeholder.
- Substances: Use `<TagList tag="Therapeutic Area Name" filter="substances" />` to list supporting substances.
- Foods: Use `<TagList tag="Therapeutic Area Name" filter="foods" />` to list foods connected via substances.
- References: Pull the relevant citations from `paper.txt` (search for the therapeutic area name and related dysfunctions) and list them in standard format using `/docs/papers/BRAIN-Diet-References#<citation_key>` links.

Use the `ADHD.md` page as an example.
