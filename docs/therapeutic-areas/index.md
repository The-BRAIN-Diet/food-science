The BRAIN Diet is designed to modulate key biological systems commonly disrupted in ADHD, depression, anxiety, cognitive decline, and other neurocognitive disorders. Each therapeutic area shares overlapping biological dysfunctions, including mitochondrial impairment, chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, impaired methylation, gut–brain axis disruption, glucose dysregulation, micronutrient deficiencies, and neurotransmitter imbalances.
