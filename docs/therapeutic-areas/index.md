# Therapeutic Areas

Explore how the BRAIN Diet supports various therapeutic applications and conditions.

The BRAIN Diet is designed to modulate key biological systems commonly disrupted in ADHD, depression, anxiety, cognitive decline, and other neurocognitive disorders. Each therapeutic area shares overlapping biological dysfunctions, including mitochondrial impairment, chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, impaired methylation, gut–brain axis disruption, glucose dysregulation, micronutrient deficiencies, and neurotransmitter imbalances.

## Therapeutic Areas

<TagList tag="Therapeutic Area" />

## Overview

The BRAIN Diet addresses these conditions through:

- **Neurotransmitter Support**: Amino acid precursors, cofactors, and omega-3s for balanced neurotransmitter production
- **Mitochondrial Support**: Creatine, CoQ10, B vitamins, and polyphenols for cellular energy production
- **Inflammation Reduction**: Omega-3s, polyphenols, and anti-inflammatory dietary patterns
- **Glucose Stabilization**: Whole-food structure, meal sequencing, and glycemic control
- **Gut-Brain Axis**: Prebiotics, probiotics, fermented foods, and psychobiotics
- **Methylation Support**: B vitamins, choline, and folate for neurotransmitter and membrane health
- **Oxidative Stress Management**: Antioxidant networks, polyphenols, and reduced AGE/ALE formation
