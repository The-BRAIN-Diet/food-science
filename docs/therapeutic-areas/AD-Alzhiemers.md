## Overview

Alzheimer’s disease shares overlapping biological dysfunctions with ADHD and bipolar disorder, including mitochondrial impairment, chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, impaired methylation, and neurotransmitter imbalance. Dietary strategies can slow cognitive decline and support neuroprotection.

Synonyms and search terms: AD, Alzheimer’s disease, Alzheimer, Alzheimers.

## Neurotransmitter Imbalance

- Cholinergic deficits are central; choline availability and membrane phospholipid turnover are relevant for acetylcholine synthesis and synaptic integrity.
- B6, B12, folate, zinc, iron, and magnesium act as cofactors for neurotransmitter pathways and methylation, impacting cognition.
- Omega-3s support synaptic membrane fluidity and neurotransmitter receptor function; in APOE4 carriers, brain DHA uptake is reduced versus non-carriers, which may affect trial outcomes and dosing considerations.

Actionable dietary focuses:
- Ensure sufficient choline (eggs, seafood, legumes/soy), B vitamins, zinc, iron, and magnesium through nutrient-dense foods.
- Regular EPA/DHA intake (fish or algal oil); consider phospholipid-bound omega-3 sources for improved brain delivery.

## Mitochondrial Support

- Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress contribute to synaptic failure and cognitive decline.
- Key nutrients: creatine, CoQ10, taurine, B vitamins (thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, folate, B12), magnesium, and DHA/EPA.
- Trace lithium has emerging evidence for neuroprotection via GSK-3β modulation, with observed depletion in AD cortex in preclinical/early translational work.

Actionable dietary focuses:
- Include seafood/organ meats or plant-forward strategies to supply CoQ10 and B vitamins; polyphenol-rich foods to bolster endogenous antioxidant defenses.
- Prefer cooking methods that limit AGE formation to reduce oxidative and inflammatory load.

## Inflammation

- Chronic neuroinflammation and impaired resolution pathways drive disease progression.
- Omega-3–derived specialized pro-resolving mediators promote resolution; Mediterranean-aligned diets are associated with reduced inflammatory tone and slower cognitive decline.

Actionable dietary focuses:
- Emphasize vegetables, legumes, nuts, seeds, whole grains, olive oil, fish, and fermented foods; reduce ultra-processed foods and excessive high-heat cooking.
- Support gut barrier integrity and microbiome diversity to lower systemic inflammation.


## Omega-3s (Cross-Cutting)

- Omega-3s (EPA/DHA) support synaptic membrane composition, neurotransmitter receptor function, mitochondrial integrity, and inflammatory resolution—core mechanisms relevant in AD.
- Sources and forms:
  - Whole-food: oily fish (salmon, sardine, mackerel, herring), shellfish; plant ALA (flax/chia/walnut) has limited conversion to DHA.
  - Supplements: fish oil or algal oil in triglyceride or re-esterified TG forms; ethyl ester forms should be taken with a fat-containing meal for absorption.
  - Phospholipid-bound omega-3s (e.g., krill oil, fish roe) may enhance brain delivery; lysophosphatidylcholine-DHA is a known transport species to the brain. APOE4 status may influence brain DHA uptake, informing form and dosing considerations.
- Cofactors and synergy:
  - Choline and phosphatidylcholine support acetylcholine synthesis and membrane phospholipid remodeling, complementing DHA incorporation into neuronal membranes.
  - Antioxidants (vitamin E, polyphenols) limit peroxidation of DHA; adequate selenium and zinc support antioxidant enzymes.
  - B vitamins (B6, folate, B12) and magnesium support methylation, neurotransmitter pathways, and mitochondrial function that interact with omega-3 biology.
- Practical guidance:
  - Ensure regular EPA/DHA intake via fish or algal oil; consider phospholipid-bound options where brain uptake is a priority.
  - Balance EPA for inflammatory tone with sufficient DHA for membrane/neuroprotective needs; sustain intake over time.
  - Take with meals containing fat; use products with third-party oxidation testing and proper storage.
