# Magnesium

## Overview

Magnesium is an essential mineral that plays a crucial role in over 300 enzymatic reactions in the body, including those critical for brain function, neurotransmitter regulation, and mitochondrial energy production. The paper highlights magnesium as particularly important for individuals with ADHD and brain health.

## Role in Brain Health

Magnesium is essential for:

- **Neurotransmitter regulation**, especially GABA (an inhibitory neurotransmitter)
- **Modulating glutamate receptors** to prevent excitotoxicity
- **Binding to ATP and all triphosphates** in cells to activate them
- **Supporting enzymes involved in glycolysis and the Krebs cycle** (processes that generate ATP from glucose)
- **Assisting enzymes involved in the synthesis of dopamine and serotonin**
- **Helping manage stress responses**
- **Key mechanism in fighting pro-oxidants and supporting antioxidants**

## Deficiency and ADHD

Deficiency is common in those with ADHD and can exacerbate symptoms like:

- Irritability
- Attention difficulties
- Sleep problems
- Anxiety

## Research Evidence

Studies have shown magnesium to be effective when combined with:

- Vitamin D supplementation (significantly reducing behavioral problems)
- Zinc and omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids
- Other B vitamins for comprehensive neurotransmitter support

## Dietary Considerations

### Absorption Rate

- **30–40%** from dietary sources

### RDA (Recommended Daily Allowance)

- **310–420 mg** for adults

### Supplementation Notes

- Often taken in amounts close to or above the RDA (200–400 mg) due to limited absorption from foods
- May be particularly beneficial for those with neurological issues, chronic stress, or fatigue

## Food Sources

### Rich Sources

- **Leafy green vegetables** (spinach, kale, Swiss chard)
- **Nuts and seeds** (almonds, pumpkin seeds, cashews)
- **Legumes** (black beans, chickpeas, lentils)
- **Whole grains** (quinoa, brown rice, oats)
- **Dark chocolate** (in moderation)
- **Avocados**
- **Bananas**

### Preparation Considerations

- Soaking and sprouting grains can improve magnesium bioavailability
- Cooking methods that preserve nutrients (steaming, light sautéing)

## Integration with BRAIN Diet

The BRAIN diet specifically emphasizes magnesium-rich foods as part of its neurotransmitter support strategy. The diet's focus on whole grains, legumes, nuts, and leafy greens provides excellent sources of this critical mineral.

## Synergistic Effects

Magnesium works synergistically with:

- **Vitamin D** for behavioral and cognitive improvements
- **Zinc** for comprehensive neurotransmitter support
- **Omega-3 fatty acids** for brain health
- **B vitamins** for methylation and energy production

## Notes

Magnesium is a cornerstone nutrient in the BRAIN diet's approach to supporting brain health through comprehensive nutritional strategies. Its role in over 300 enzymatic reactions makes it essential for the diet's goals of optimizing neurobiological function.
