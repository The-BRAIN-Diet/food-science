## Overview

Chlorella is a microalgae providing bioavailable, true vitamin B12 (cobalamin) confirmed in animal feeding trials, plus antioxidants and amino acids. Chlorella contains bioavailable, true vitamin B12 (cobalamin), confirmed in animal feeding trials, and may help close vegan nutrient gaps.

## References

- Chlorella contains bioavailable, true vitamin B12 (cobalamin), confirmed in animal feeding trials, and may help close vegan nutrient gaps [Watanabe et al. 2002](/docs/papers/BRAIN-Diet-References#watanabe_characterization_2002). By contrast, spirulina is dominated by pseudovitamin B12 analogues, which are inactive in humans and therefore unsuitable as a primary B12 source. Nonetheless, both algae provide antioxidant and amino acid support
