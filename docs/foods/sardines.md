## Overview

Sardines are small, sustainable oily fish providing EPA/DHA omega-3s, CoQ10, calcium (from bones), and B vitamins with low heavy metal burden. Sardines are listed as top animal sources for omega-3 (EPA/DHA) and CoQ10, supporting brain health and mitochondrial function. Regular consumption of oily fish to meet baseline omega-3 requirements (~250–500 mg/day EPA+DHA) is recommended.
