## Overview

Lemon provides vitamin C that enhances non-heme iron absorption and can be used to adjust pH in food preparation (e.g., bean soaking). Pairing plant-based iron sources with citrus enhances iron absorption, and adding vitamin-C sources (e.g., lemon) favors iron uptake.

## References

- Pairing plant-based iron sources with citrus (Hallberg et al. 1989) enhances iron absorption
- Absorption note: Polyphenol-rich beverages (tea/coffee) can reduce non-heme iron absorption if taken with iron-rich plant meals; spacing them ≥1 hour away or adding vitamin-C sources (e.g., lemon) favors iron uptake
- Add a bit of lemon juice or apple cider vinegar (1–2 tsp per liter of water) to reach ~pH 5.5–6 for bean soaking
- Eat your beans with vitamin C-rich foods (e.g., tomatoes, peppers, citrus)
