## Overview

Black beans provide plant protein, polyphenols, and prebiotic fiber. The paper details optimal soaking conditions (60°C, pH 6.0) for phytate reduction.

## Key Substances

### Nutrients
- **Protein**: Plant protein (methionine-limited)
- **Fiber**: Prebiotic fiber
- **Iron**: Non-heme iron
- **Folate (B9)**: Methylation support

### Bioactive Substances
- **Polyphenols**: Antioxidant compounds

## From the paper

- "Optimal conditions for the endogenous phytases of black beans, is 60C and pH 6.0, that resulted in a 55% reduction in 1P6 after soaking and cooking"
- "Kidney beans: DIAAS 60-65, Methionine - Polyphenol-rich; supports gut health"

## Preparation Notes

- Soak at 60°C (warm water) with pH 6.0 (lemon/vinegar) for optimal phytate reduction
- Soak 12-24 hours, then cook thoroughly
- Pair with grains for complete amino acid profile
- Pair with vitamin C to enhance iron absorption
