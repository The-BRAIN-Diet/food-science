## Overview

Black beans provide plant protein, polyphenols, and prebiotic fiber. The paper details optimal soaking conditions (60°C, pH 6.0) for phytate reduction. Optimal conditions for the endogenous phytases of black beans is 60°C and pH 6.0, that resulted in a 55% reduction in 1P6 after soaking and cooking. Black beans are polyphenol-rich and support gut health, similar to kidney beans.

## Preparation Notes

- Soak at 60°C (warm water) with pH 6.0 (lemon/vinegar) for optimal phytate reduction; optimal conditions for the endogenous phytases of black beans is 60°C and pH 6.0, that resulted in a 55% reduction in 1P6 after soaking and cooking
- Soak 12-24 hours, then cook thoroughly to reduce phytates and improve mineral bioavailability
- Pair with grains for complete amino acid profile; grain-legume complementarity improves essential amino-acid coverage
- Pair with vitamin C to enhance iron absorption, with studies showing up to a fourfold increase when consumed together [Hallberg et al. 1989](/docs/papers/BRAIN-Diet-References#hallberg_iron_1989)
- Soaking and sprouting reduces phytates in legumes/grains, improving non-heme iron and zinc bioavailability [GREINER and KONIETZNY 1999](/docs/papers/BRAIN-Diet-References#greiner_phytate_1999)
