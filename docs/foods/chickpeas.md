## Overview

Chickpeas are legumes providing plant protein, prebiotic fiber, folate, magnesium, and B6, supporting gut health and neurotransmitter synthesis. Chickpeas have a DIAAS score of 64-69, indicating they are methionine-limited and should be paired with grains for complete amino acid profile. Chickpeas are listed as sources for magnesium, iron, zinc, and B6, all critical cofactors for neurotransmitter synthesis.

## Preparation Notes

- Soak and cook thoroughly to reduce phytates and improve mineral bioavailability; soaking and sprouting reduces phytates in legumes/grains, improving non-heme iron and zinc bioavailability
- Pair with grains for complete amino acid profile; combine with grains like barley or oats for amino acid complementarity
- Pair with vitamin C to enhance iron absorption, with studies showing up to a fourfold increase when consumed together
- Part of grain-legume complementarity strategy
- Legumes such as lentils and chickpeas provide complex carbs and fiber

- Zinc: Neurotransmitter modulation, synaptic plasticity, antioxidant enzymes; food sources include oysters, beef, crab, chicken, pork, pumpkin seeds, lentils, chickpeas, cashews
- B6 (chickpeas, potatoes, bananas, whole grains, soy) is a cofactor in the development of all key neurotransmitters
- Combine with grains like barley or oats for amino acid complementarity; grain-legume complementarity improves essential amino-acid coverage
