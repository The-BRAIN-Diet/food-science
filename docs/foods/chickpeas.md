## Overview

Chickpeas are legumes providing plant protein, prebiotic fiber, folate, magnesium, and B6, supporting gut health and neurotransmitter synthesis.

## Key Substances

### Nutrients
- **Protein**: DIAAS 64-69, methionine-limited (pair with grains)
- **Fiber**: Prebiotic fiber (GOS)
- **Folate (B9)**: Methylation and neurotransmitter synthesis
- **Magnesium**: Cofactor for neurotransmitter pathways
- **Iron**: Non-heme iron
- **B6**: Neurotransmitter cofactor
- **Zinc**: Plant source (improve bioavailability via soaking)

## From the paper

- "Chickpeas: DIAAS 64-69, Methionine - Good source of magnesium and iron"
- "Zinc: Pumpkin seeds, lentils, chickpeas, cashews"
- "B6(chickpeas, potatoes, bananas, whole grains, soy)"
- "Combine with grains like barley or oats" for amino acid complementarity
- "Legumes such as lentils and chickpeas" for complex carbs and fiber

## Preparation Notes

- Soak and cook thoroughly to reduce phytates
- Pair with grains for complete amino acid profile
- Pair with vitamin C to enhance iron absorption
- Part of grain-legume complementarity strategy
