## Overview

Sesame seeds provide calcium, healthy fats, and are the source of tahini, supporting bone health and carotenoid absorption when paired with vegetables. Practical pairings: carrots + tahini, kale + avocado, berries + yogurt/nuts. Sesame seeds are part of diverse seed intake and support fat-soluble vitamin absorption when used as tahini.

## Preparation Notes

- Can be consumed whole or as tahini; tahini is ground sesame seeds
- Part of diverse seed intake; dietary diversity (≥30 plant foods per week) supports microbial richness and resilience
- Supports fat-soluble vitamin absorption when used as tahini; co-consuming a small amount of unsaturated fat improves micelle formation and chylomicron packaging, increasing carotenoid and fat-soluble vitamin absorption
- Pair with carotenoid-rich vegetables; practical pairings: carrots + tahini
