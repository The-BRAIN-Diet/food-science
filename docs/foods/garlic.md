## Overview

Garlic provides allicin (when crushed), sulfur compounds for glutathione synthesis, and prebiotic fiber supporting gut health and antioxidant defenses.

## Key Substances

### Nutrients

- **Fiber**: Prebiotic fiber
- **Manganese**: Cofactor for antioxidant enzymes

### Bioactive Substances

- **Allicin**: Formed when garlic is crushed; antimicrobial and antioxidant
- **Sulfur compounds**: Glutathione precursors
- **Polyphenols**: Antioxidant compounds

## From the paper

- "Sulphur-containing vegetables that provide glutathione precursors (e.g., broccoli, Brussels sprouts, garlic, onions)"
- "Niacin-rich foods (e.g., salmon, chicken breast, turkey, peanuts, and mushrooms), sulphur-containing vegetables that provide glutathione precursors (e.g., broccoli, Brussels sprouts, garlic, onions)"
- Part of allium family with prebiotic benefits

## Preparation Notes

- Crush or chop to activate allicin formation
- Allow to sit 10 minutes after crushing before cooking
- Cooking reduces allicin but may enhance other compounds
- Part of diverse plant food strategy
