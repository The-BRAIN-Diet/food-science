## Overview

Garlic provides allicin (when crushed), sulfur compounds for glutathione synthesis, and prebiotic fiber supporting gut health and antioxidant defenses. Sulphur-containing vegetables that provide glutathione precursors (e.g., broccoli, Brussels sprouts, garlic, onions) support NAD+ availability, glutathione synthesis, and mitochondrial health. Garlic is part of the allium family with prebiotic benefits.

## Preparation Notes

- Crush or chop to activate allicin formation; allicin is formed when garlic is crushed
- Allow to sit 10 minutes after crushing before cooking to maximize allicin formation
- Cooking reduces allicin but may enhance other compounds
- Part of diverse plant food strategy; dietary diversity (≥30 plant foods per week) supports microbial richness and resilience
- Sulphur-containing vegetables that provide glutathione precursors support antioxidant defenses
