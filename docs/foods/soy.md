## Overview

Soy provides complete plant protein (DIAAS 92-96), isoflavones (genistein), and choline, supporting neurotransmitter synthesis and neuroprotection.

## Key Substances

### Nutrients
- **Protein**: DIAAS 92-96, methionine-limited (pair with grains)
- **Choline**: Supports phosphatidylcholine synthesis
- **Folate (B9)**: Methylation support
- **Iron**: Non-heme iron
- **B6**: Neurotransmitter cofactor

### Bioactive Substances
- **Genistein**: Soy isoflavone with neuroprotective effects
- **Isoflavones**: Support endocannabinoid system and neuroinflammation modulation

## From the paper

- "Soy protein isolate: DIAAS 92-96, Methionine - Supports neurotransmitter synthesis; contains isoflavones with neuroprotective potential"
- "Genistein a soy-derived isoflavonoid, has shown potential as a modulator of several biochemical pathways, including the endocannabinoid system and neuroinflammation"
- "Quercetin... abundant in capers, apples, onions, berries, kale and soybeans"
- "Acetylcholine and choline: Egg yolks, fish roe, soy, wheat germ, liver"
- "B6(chickpeas, potatoes, bananas, whole grains, soy)"

## Preparation Notes

- Fermented forms (tempeh, miso, natto) may have additional benefits
- Pair with grains for complete amino acid profile
- Part of diverse plant protein strategy
- Supports choline and neurotransmitter synthesis
