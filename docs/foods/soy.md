## Overview

Soy provides complete plant protein (DIAAS 92-96), isoflavones (genistein), and choline, supporting neurotransmitter synthesis and neuroprotection. Soy protein isolate has a DIAAS score of 92-96, indicating high protein quality, though it is methionine-limited and should be paired with grains. Genistein, a soy-derived isoflavonoid, has shown potential as a modulator of several biochemical pathways, including the endocannabinoid system and neuroinflammation. Soy is listed as a source for choline, tryptophan, tyrosine, and B6.

## Preparation Notes

- Fermented forms (tempeh, miso, natto) may have additional benefits including probiotics and improved digestibility
- Pair with grains for complete amino acid profile; grain-legume complementarity improves essential amino-acid coverage
- Part of diverse plant protein strategy
- Supports choline and neurotransmitter synthesis
- Vegans should ensure adequate choline intake (e.g., soy or sunflower lecithin, soy foods, quinoa, broccoli) to support phosphatidylcholine synthesis
