## Key Substances

### Nutrients
- **Fiber**: Prebiotic fiber
- **Vitamin C**: Antioxidant

### Bioactive Substances
- **Anthocyanins (C3G)**: Cyanidin-3-glucoside for metal chelation and neuroprotection
- **Polyphenols**: Antioxidant compounds

## From the paper

- "Anthocyanins, especially C3G-rich sources like berries, purple potatoes, and black goji, serve as: Natural chelation agents for heavy metals and environmental contaminants; Neuroprotective molecules that support synaptic resilience and detox pathways; Detox allies against microplastics and hormone-disrupting pollutants"

## Preparation Notes

- Can be consumed dried or fresh
- Part of diverse polyphenol intake
- Supports detoxification pathways
- Pair with other C3G-rich foods
