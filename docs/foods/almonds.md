## Overview

Almonds provide vitamin E (antioxidant), plant protein, and monounsaturated fats, supporting antioxidant networks and neurotransmitter function. Almonds have a DIAAS score of 47-52, lysine-limited; vitamin E for antioxidant protection. Pair with soy or legumes for amino acid complementarity. GABA: Green tea, fermented foods, polyphenols (genistein), spinach, almonds, pumpkin seeds.

## Preparation Notes

- Soak to reduce phytates and improve mineral bioavailability; soaking and sprouting reduces phytates in legumes/grains, improving non-heme iron and zinc bioavailability
- Pair with legumes for complete amino acid profile; pair with soy or legumes for amino acid complementarity
- Part of diverse nut/seed intake; dietary diversity (≥30 plant foods per week) supports microbial richness and resilience
- Supports antioxidant networks; vitamin E works within antioxidant networks with vitamin C, CoQ10, and polyphenols, with these compounds regenerating each other in vivo
