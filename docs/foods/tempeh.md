## Overview

Tempeh is fermented soy providing live probiotics, enhanced nutrient bioavailability, and isoflavones, supporting gut health and neurotransmitter synthesis. Fermented Foods: Sauerkraut, kimchi, kefir, miso, kombucha, tempeh provide live microbes + postbiotic peptides; improved SCFA pools; vagal signaling. Tempeh: Fermented soybeans, high in protein and probiotics. Fermentation improves digestibility and nutrient bioavailability.

## Substances

<FoodSubstances details={frontMatter} />

## Preparation Notes

- Fermentation improves digestibility and nutrient bioavailability; lactic acid bacteria acidify the medium, activating microbial and endogenous phytases, while also increasing B-vitamin levels
- Can be cooked various ways; gentle cooking preserves probiotics
- Part of fermented foods rotation; fermented foods provide live microbes + postbiotic peptides; improved SCFA pools; vagal signaling
- Supports gut microbiome diversity; dietary diversity (≥30 plant foods per week) supports microbial richness and resilience

- Fermentation produces beneficial organic acids and partially pre-digests starch and protein—improving both digestibility and glycaemic response
- Genistein, a soy-derived isoflavonoid, has shown potential as a modulator of several biochemical pathways, including the endocannabinoid system and neuroinflammation
