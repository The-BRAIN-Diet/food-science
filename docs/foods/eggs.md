## Overview

Eggs, especially egg yolks, are nutrient-dense sources of complete protein, choline, B vitamins, and phospholipids. Pasture-raised egg yolks provide essential brain nutrients including choline, vitamin K2, butyrate, and fat-soluble vitamins A, D, and E. Eggs support neurotransmitter synthesis and membrane health, with complete amino acid profile (DIAAS 113) and are listed as sources for tryptophan and tyrosine, neurotransmitter precursors for serotonin and dopamine synthesis respectively.

## Preparation Notes

- Gentle cooking preserves nutrients and prevents formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs)
- Pair with vegetables for carotenoid absorption (dietary fat enhances absorption of fat-soluble vitamins)
- Consider pasture-raised for higher omega-3 and vitamin content
- Regular choline intake supports ongoing acetylcholine synthesis; important for structural membrane health
- Eggs provide phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), which can convert to phosphatidylcholine (PC) or N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamines (NAPEs) for endocannabinoid system support
