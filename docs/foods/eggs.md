## Overview

Eggs, especially egg yolks, are nutrient-dense sources of complete protein, choline, B vitamins, and phospholipids. They support neurotransmitter synthesis and membrane health.

## Key Substances

### Nutrients
- **Protein**: Complete amino acid profile (DIAAS 113)
- **Choline**: High levels for acetylcholine synthesis
- **B Vitamins**: B2, B5, B12, folate
- **Selenium**: Antioxidant support
- **Vitamin A, D, E, K2**: Fat-soluble vitamins

### Bioactive Substances
- **Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)**: Precursor to endocannabinoids
- **Lutein/Zeaxanthin**: Carotenoids for eye and brain health

## From the paper

- "Pasture-raised egg yolks" provide "essential brain nutrients including choline, vitamin K2, butyrate, and fat-soluble vitamins A, D, and E"
- Listed as source for tryptophan and tyrosine (neurotransmitter precursors)
- "Eggs" mentioned as protein source with complete amino acid profile

## Preparation Notes

- Gentle cooking preserves nutrients
- Pair with vegetables for carotenoid absorption
- Consider pasture-raised for higher omega-3 and vitamin content
