## Overview

Barley provides beta-glucan prebiotic fiber and whole grain nutrients, supporting gut microbiome diversity and stable glucose release.

## Key Substances

### Nutrients
- **Beta-glucans**: Prebiotic fiber for gut microbiome
- **Fiber**: Soluble and insoluble fiber
- **B Vitamins**: Various B vitamins
- **Magnesium**: Cofactor

- "Beta-glucans: Oats, barley, mushrooms"
- "Whole grains (including... grains like barley and oats)"
- "Chickpeas: Combine with grains like barley or oats" for amino acid complementarity

## Preparation Notes

- Soak before cooking to reduce phytates
- Part of whole grain diversity
- Supports gut microbiome via beta-glucans
- Pair with legumes for complete amino acid profile
