## Overview

Barley provides beta-glucan prebiotic fiber and whole grain nutrients, supporting gut microbiome diversity and stable glucose release. Beta-glucans: Oats, barley, mushrooms. Whole grains (including... grains like barley and oats) support gut health and stable glucose release. Chickpeas: Combine with grains like barley or oats for amino acid complementarity.

## Preparation Notes

- Soak before cooking to reduce phytates and improve mineral bioavailability
- Part of whole grain diversity strategy
- Supports gut microbiome via beta-glucans; beta-glucans support Bifidobacterium, Akkermansia; ↑ butyrate production; improved gut barrier
- Pair with legumes for complete amino acid profile; combine with legumes like chickpeas for amino acid complementarity
