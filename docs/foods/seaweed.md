## Overview

Seaweed provides iodine, EPA (in red algae), glycolipids, magnesium, and fiber, supporting thyroid function and brain health.

## Key Substances

### Nutrients

- **Iodine**: Critical for thyroid and brain function
- **EPA**: In red algae (low bioavailable)
- **Magnesium**: Cofactor
- **Fiber**: Prebiotic fiber

### Bioactive Substances

- **Glycolipids**: Lipid compounds

## From the paper

- "Seaweed (Whole): Glycolipids, EPA (in red algae), iodine, magnesium, fibre - Added to soups, stews, or salads"
- "EPA & DHA (Omega-3): Algal oil (direct DHA), seaweed (low bioavailable DHA/EPA)"
- "Creatine: Minimal — trace amounts in seaweed (e.g., nori)"
- "Taurine: Minimal in plants; trace in seaweed/algae"

## Preparation Notes

- Can be added to soups, stews, or salads
- Important for iodine intake (especially for plant-based diets)
- Part of diverse plant food strategy
- Low bioavailable EPA; consider algal oil for direct DHA
