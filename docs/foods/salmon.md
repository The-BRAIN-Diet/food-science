## Overview

Salmon is an oily fish that provides high-quality protein, omega-3 fatty acids (EPA/DHA), B vitamins, and other brain-supportive nutrients. It's a cornerstone food in the BRAIN Diet for meeting omega-3 requirements, with regular consumption recommended to meet baseline omega-3 requirements (~250–500 mg/day EPA+DHA). Salmon provides complete amino acid profile (DIAAS 105-108) and is listed as a top animal source for omega-3 fatty acids.

## Preparation Notes

- Best prepared with gentle cooking to preserve omega-3s and prevent oxidation
- Avoid high-heat cooking that creates advanced glycation end products (AGEs)
- Can be consumed raw (sushi-grade) or lightly cooked
- Targeted foods such as salmon can be used to reliably and safely exceed minimum omega-3 intakes

- Regular consumption of oily fish to meet baseline omega-3 requirements (~250–500 mg/day EPA+DHA)
- Targeted foods such as salmon or lumpfish roe can be used to reliably and safely exceed minimum intakes
- Omega-3 fatty acids, particularly EPA and DHA, exert multifaceted effects on brain function including modulation of nuclear receptor signaling, support for phospholipid membrane dynamics, and generation of specialized proresolving mediators (SPMs) that downregulate inflammatory responses
- Most research showing brain function improvements lean towards higher ratio of EPA to DHA (e.g., 2:1 ratio or higher) with DHA having a more structural role in the brain and EPA with a more functional role [McNamara and Carlson 2006](/docs/papers/BRAIN-Diet-References#mcnamara_role_2006) [Stonehouse et al. 2013](/docs/papers/BRAIN-Diet-References#stonehouse_dha_2013)
- Salmon roe provides DHA, EPA, phospholipids, choline, astaxanthin; highly bioavailable; zero oxidation risk
