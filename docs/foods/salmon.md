## Overview

Salmon is an oily fish that provides high-quality protein, omega-3 fatty acids (EPA/DHA), B vitamins, and other brain-supportive nutrients. It's a cornerstone food in the BRAIN Diet for meeting omega-3 requirements.

## Key Substances

### Nutrients

- **Omega-3 (EPA/DHA)**: High levels of EPA and DHA for membrane fluidity and anti-inflammatory effects
- **Protein**: Complete amino acid profile (DIAAS 105-108)
- **B Vitamins**: B3 (niacin), B6, B12
- **Selenium**: Antioxidant support
- **Vitamin D**: Important for brain health

### Bioactive Substances

- **Astaxanthin**: Carotenoid antioxidant (especially in wild salmon)

## From the paper

- Listed as top animal source for omega-3 (EPA/DHA) with DIAAS 105-108
- "Regular consumption of oily fish to meet baseline omega-3 requirements (~250–500 mg/day EPA+DHA)"
- "Targeted foods such as salmon or lumpfish roe can be used to reliably and safely exceed minimum intakes"

## Preparation Notes

- Best prepared with gentle cooking to preserve omega-3s
- Avoid high-heat cooking that creates AGEs
- Can be consumed raw (sushi-grade) or lightly cooked
