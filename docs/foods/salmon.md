## Overview

Salmon is an oily fish that provides high-quality protein, omega-3 fatty acids (EPA/DHA), B vitamins, and other brain-supportive nutrients. It's a cornerstone food in the BRAIN Diet for meeting omega-3 requirements, with regular consumption recommended to meet baseline omega-3 requirements (~250–500 mg/day EPA+DHA). Salmon provides complete amino acid profile (DIAAS 105-108) and is listed as a top animal source for omega-3 fatty acids.

## Preparation Notes

- Best prepared with gentle cooking to preserve omega-3s and prevent oxidation
- Avoid high-heat cooking that creates advanced glycation end products (AGEs)
- Can be consumed raw (sushi-grade) or lightly cooked
- Targeted foods such as salmon can be used to reliably and safely exceed minimum omega-3 intakes

## Sourcing

Both wild-caught and responsibly farm-raised salmon can be good options. Where possible, choose salmon that is sustainably sourced and labelled as free from routine antibiotics and unnecessary additives, whether wild or farmed.

Please be sure to research your supermarket and their suppliers — many are moving towards more sustainable, ethical sourcing (e.g. [M&amp;S Aquaculture and Fisheries](https://corporate.marksandspencer.com/sustainability/our-products/aquaculture-and-fisheries)). For a balanced overview of wild versus farmed salmon, see resources such as the summary from [North Coast Seafoods](https://www.northcoastseafoods.com/blogs/know-seafood/farm-raised-vs-wild-caught-salmon).

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) jointly publish [guidance on fish mercury levels](https://www.fda.gov/food/environmental-contaminants-food/technical-information-development-fdaepa-advice-about-eating-fish-those-who-might-become-or-are). They categorize fish into "Best Choices", "Good Choices", and "Choices to Avoid" based on average mercury concentrations and safe weekly intake levels. Salmon is repeatedly in the "Best Choices" category because it consistently has low mercury relative to the reference dose used to set safety advice (≤0.15 µg/g).

- Omega-3 fatty acids, particularly EPA and DHA, exert multifaceted effects on brain function including modulation of nuclear receptor signaling, support for phospholipid membrane dynamics, and generation of specialized proresolving mediators (SPMs) that downregulate inflammatory responses
- Most research showing brain function improvements lean towards higher ratio of EPA to DHA (e.g., 2:1 ratio or higher) with DHA having a more structural role in the brain and EPA with a more functional role [McNamara and Carlson 2006](/docs/papers/BRAIN-Diet-References#mcnamara_role_2006) [Stonehouse et al. 2013](/docs/papers/BRAIN-Diet-References#stonehouse_dha_2013)
- Salmon roe provides DHA, EPA, phospholipids, choline, astaxanthin; highly bioavailable; zero oxidation risk
