description: Niacin, resveratrol, and plant protein for NAD+ and mitochondrial support
---

## Overview

Peanuts provide niacin (B3) for NAD+ synthesis, resveratrol (polyphenol), and plant protein supporting mitochondrial function and antioxidant networks.

## Key Substances

### Nutrients
- **Niacin (B3)**: NAD+ precursor for mitochondrial energy
- **Protein**: Plant protein source
- **Folate (B9)**: Methylation support
- **Magnesium**: Cofactor

### Bioactive Substances
- **Resveratrol**: Polyphenol that activates SIRT1, enhancing NAD+-dependent processes
- **Polyphenols**: Antioxidant compounds

## From the paper

- "Niacin (Vitamin B₃): Chicken, turkey, tuna, salmon, mushrooms, peanuts, whole grains"
- "Niacin-rich foods (e.g., salmon, chicken breast, turkey, peanuts, and mushrooms)"
- "Polyphenols (e.g., resveratrol): Grapes, blueberries, cranberries, peanuts, dark chocolate"
- "Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN): Edamame, broccoli, cucumber, avocado" (peanuts also contain some)

## Preparation Notes

- Choose dry-roasted or raw over oil-roasted
- Soak to reduce phytates
- Part of diverse plant protein strategy
- Pair with grains for complete amino acid profile
