## Overview

Peanuts provide niacin (B3) for NAD+ synthesis, resveratrol (polyphenol), and plant protein supporting mitochondrial function and antioxidant networks. Niacin (Vitamin B₃): Directly converted to NAD+ via salvage pathway; food sources include chicken, turkey, tuna, salmon, mushrooms, peanuts, whole grains. Niacin-rich foods (e.g., salmon, chicken breast, turkey, peanuts, and mushrooms) support NAD+ availability, glutathione synthesis, and mitochondrial health.

## Preparation Notes

- Choose dry-roasted or raw over oil-roasted to preserve nutrients and avoid excess omega-6
- Soak to reduce phytates and improve mineral bioavailability
- Part of diverse plant protein strategy; dietary diversity (≥30 plant foods per week) supports microbial richness and resilience
- Pair with grains for complete amino acid profile; grain-legume complementarity improves essential amino-acid coverage

- Polyphenols (e.g., resveratrol): Grapes, blueberries, cranberries, peanuts, dark chocolate; resveratrol activates SIRT1, enhancing NAD+-dependent processes
- Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN): Direct NAD⁺ intermediate in salvage pathway; food sources include edamame, broccoli, cucumber, avocado (peanuts also contain some)
