## Overview

Fortified plant milks (soy, almond, oat, etc.) provide essential nutrients like B12, vitamin D, and sometimes iodine, helping close vegan nutrient gaps.

## Key Substances

### Nutrients
- **Vitamin B12**: Fortified (methylcobalamin preferred)
- **Vitamin D**: Fortified (especially important for vegans)
- **Calcium**: Often fortified
- **Iodine**: Sometimes fortified (varies by product and region)

## From the paper

- "Fortified plant milks and dairy milk can help meet calcium (and sometimes iodine, depending on fortification and local practices) targets"
- "Targets foods providing essential brain supporting vitamins: D (UV-exposed mushrooms; fortified plant milks/yogurts), B12 (fortified plant milks, nutritional yeast)"
- "Vitamin B12: Fortified plant milks, nutritional yeast, supplements"

## Preparation Notes

- Choose fortified varieties for B12 and D
- Check fortification levels and forms (methylcobalamin for B12)
- Important for vegan/vegetarian nutrient sufficiency
- Part of functional food strategy
