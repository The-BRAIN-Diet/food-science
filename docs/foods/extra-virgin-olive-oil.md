## Overview

Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) is a cornerstone fat in the BRAIN Diet. **Importantly, olive oil's brain benefits come from polyphenols, not fatty acids.** The bioactive power of EVOO is derived from secoiridoids and phenolics, including:

- **Oleuropein aglycone** → supports mitophagy, SIRT1 activation, and AMPK activation
- **Oleocanthal** → NF-κB inhibition, anti-inflammatory effects
- **Oleacein** → antioxidant, NRF2 activation
- **Tyrosol / Hydroxytyrosol** → neuroprotective effects

Early harvest extra virgin olive oil contains significantly higher concentrations of these bioactive compounds (CoQ10, oleuropein, oleocanthal, oleacein, hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol) compared to standard EVOO or regular olive oil. Total CoQ10 can drop by 53-56% between early and late harvest, highlighting the importance of harvest timing for maximizing bioactive content. These enhanced polyphenol levels support mitochondrial function, antioxidant networks, and anti-inflammatory pathways, making early harvest olive oil a valuable component of precision dietary strategies for brain health.

## Preparation Notes

- Best used for salad dressings, drizzling, low-heat cooking to preserve polyphenols
- Avoid high-heat cooking to preserve polyphenols and prevent oxidation
- Early harvest oils have higher bioactive content (CoQ10, oleuropein, polyphenols)
- Store away from heat and light to preserve antioxidant properties
- Total CoQ dropped by 53%-56% between three weeks of the harvesting of two brands, highlighting importance of harvest timing
