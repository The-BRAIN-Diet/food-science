## Overview

Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) is a cornerstone fat in the BRAIN Diet, providing monounsaturated fats, polyphenols, and lipid bioactives that support brain health through anti-inflammatory and antioxidant mechanisms.

## Key Substances

### Nutrients
- **Monounsaturated Fats (MUFA)**: Oleic acid (~10-15% of calories)
- **Vitamin E**: Fat-soluble antioxidant

### Bioactive Substances
- **Hydroxytyrosol**: Powerful polyphenol antioxidant
- **CoQ10**: Mitochondrial support (varies by harvest time/producer)
- **Oleuropein**: Polyphenol with neuroprotective effects
- **Squalene**: Lipid bioactive

## From the paper

- "Extra Virgin Olive Oil: Oleic acid, coQ10, hydroxytyrosol, squalene; strong antioxidant & anti-inflammatory profile"
- "Early harvest extra virgin olive oil with higher levels of CoQ10, oleuropein and polyphenols"
- "Total CoQ dropped by 53%-56% between three weeks of the harvesting of two brands"
- "Sources: extra-virgin olive oil, avocado, olives, nuts" for MUFA

## Preparation Notes

- Best used for salad dressings, drizzling, low-heat cooking
- Avoid high-heat cooking to preserve polyphenols
- Early harvest oils have higher bioactive content
- Store away from heat and light
