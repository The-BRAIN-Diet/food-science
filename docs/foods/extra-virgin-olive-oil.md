## Overview

Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) is a cornerstone fat in the BRAIN Diet. **Importantly, olive oil's brain benefits come from polyphenols, not fatty acids.** The bioactive power of EVOO is derived from secoiridoids and phenolics, including:

- **Oleuropein aglycone** → supports mitophagy, SIRT1 activation, and AMPK activation
- **Oleocanthal** → NF-κB inhibition, anti-inflammatory effects
- **Oleacein** → antioxidant, NRF2 activation
- **Tyrosol / Hydroxytyrosol** → neuroprotective effects

Early harvest extra virgin olive oil contains significantly higher concentrations of these bioactive compounds (oleuropein, oleocanthal, oleacein, hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol) compared to standard EVOO or regular olive oil. Early harvest oils may also contain CoQ10 in useful quantities, though standard EVOO typically does not. These enhanced polyphenol levels support mitochondrial function, antioxidant networks, and anti-inflammatory pathways, making early harvest olive oil a valuable component of precision dietary strategies for brain health.

## Preparation Notes

- Best used for salad dressings, drizzling, low-heat cooking to preserve polyphenols
- Avoid high-heat cooking to preserve polyphenols and prevent oxidation
- Early harvest oils have higher bioactive content (oleuropein, polyphenols) and may contain CoQ10 in useful quantities
- Store away from heat and light to preserve antioxidant properties
