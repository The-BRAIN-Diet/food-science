## Overview

Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) is a cornerstone fat in the BRAIN Diet, providing monounsaturated fats, polyphenols, and lipid bioactives that support brain health through anti-inflammatory and antioxidant mechanisms. Extra Virgin Olive Oil provides oleic acid, CoQ10, hydroxytyrosol, squalene; strong antioxidant & anti-inflammatory profile. Early harvest extra virgin olive oil has higher levels of CoQ10, oleuropein, and polyphenols, making it valuable for precision dietary strategies.

- Early harvest oils have higher bioactive content (CoQ10, oleuropein, polyphenols)
- Store away from heat and light to preserve antioxidant properties
- Total CoQ dropped by 53%-56% between three weeks of the harvesting of two brands, highlighting importance of harvest timing
