## Overview

Organ meats (offal) are among the most nutrient-dense foods, providing high levels of B12, CoQ10, iron, and other brain-supportive nutrients. Organ meats (heart, liver), oily fish (sardines, mackerel), beef are top sources for CoQ10, and occasional offal consumption is recommended for nutrient density.
