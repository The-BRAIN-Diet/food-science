## Overview

Flax seeds provide ALA (plant omega-3), soluble fiber, and lignans, supporting gut health and providing plant-based omega-3. Soluble fibre (from apples, oats, flaxseeds) supports gut health and SCFA production. ALA is an essential omega-3 fatty acid with limited conversion to DHA/EPA in adults; food sources include flax, chia, and walnuts. Conversion from ALA is less than 5% in most adults; direct DHA/EPA strongly recommended for optimal brain health.

## Substances

<FoodSubstances details={frontMatter} />

## Preparation Notes

- Grind for better ALA absorption (whole seeds may pass through undigested)
- Store ground seeds in refrigerator to prevent oxidation of omega-3s
- Part of diverse seed intake; dietary diversity (≥30 plant foods per week) supports microbial richness and resilience
- Limited ALA-to-DHA conversion; consider algal DHA for direct omega-3 support; conversion from ALA is less than 5% in most adults
