## Overview

Swiss chard is a nutrient-dense leafy green providing iron, magnesium, folate, and carotenoids. Similar to other leafy greens like kale and spinach, it supports neurotransmitter synthesis and antioxidant function.

## Key Substances

### Nutrients

- **Iron**: Non-heme iron (enhance absorption with vitamin C)
- **Magnesium**: Cofactor for enzymatic reactions and neurotransmitter pathways
- **Folate (B9)**: Methylation and neurotransmitter synthesis support
- **Vitamin K**: High content for blood clotting and bone health
- **Vitamin A**: From beta-carotene conversion

### Bioactive Substances

- **Carotenoids**: Lutein, zeaxanthin, beta-carotene for eye and brain health
- **Oxalates**: Can bind minerals; reduce via boiling

## From the paper

- "The BRAIN diet specifically targets leafy green vegetables i.e. kale and spinach that are rich in iron, magnesium, and zinc"
- "Boiling spinach, kale, and other greens can reduce oxalate load, improving mineral bioavailability"
- Swiss chard, as a leafy green, fits within the category of vegetables targeted for their iron, magnesium, and zinc content

## Preparation Notes

- Boiling reduces oxalates and improves mineral bioavailability
- Pair with vitamin C sources to enhance iron absorption
- Pair with fat (olive oil, avocado) for carotenoid absorption
- Part of diverse leafy green strategy
- Can be used raw in salads or cooked in various dishes
