## Overview

Swiss chard is a nutrient-dense leafy green providing iron, magnesium, folate, and carotenoids. Similar to other leafy greens like kale and spinach, it supports neurotransmitter synthesis and antioxidant function. The BRAIN diet specifically targets leafy green vegetables such as kale and spinach that are rich in iron, magnesium, and zinc, and Swiss chard fits within this category.
