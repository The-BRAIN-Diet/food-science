## Overview

Mushrooms, especially UV-exposed varieties, provide vitamin D and niacin (B3) for NAD+ synthesis, supporting mitochondrial function and brain health.

## Key Substances

### Nutrients
- **Niacin (B3)**: NAD+ precursor for mitochondrial energy
- **Vitamin D**: When UV-exposed (ergocalciferol)
- **Selenium**: Antioxidant support
- **B Vitamins**: Various B vitamins

## From the paper

- "UV-exposed mushrooms as a source of vitamin D"
- "Niacin-rich foods (e.g., salmon, chicken breast, turkey, peanuts, and mushrooms)"
- "Niacin (Vitamin B₃): Chicken, turkey, tuna, salmon, mushrooms, peanuts, whole grains"
- "UV-grown mushrooms" mentioned as functional food innovation
- "Targets foods providing essential brain supporting vitamins: D (UV-exposed mushrooms; fortified plant milks/yogurts)"

## Preparation Notes

- UV-exposed mushrooms provide vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol)
- Cooking may enhance some nutrient bioavailability
- Include in diverse plant food rotation
