## Overview

Mushrooms, especially UV-exposed varieties, provide vitamin D and niacin (B3) for NAD+ synthesis, supporting mitochondrial function and brain health. UV-exposed mushrooms as a source of vitamin D. Niacin-rich foods (e.g., salmon, chicken breast, turkey, peanuts, and mushrooms) support NAD+ availability, glutathione synthesis, and mitochondrial health. Niacin (Vitamin B₃): Directly converted to NAD+ via salvage pathway; food sources include chicken, turkey, tuna, salmon, mushrooms, peanuts, whole grains.

## Preparation Notes

- UV-exposed mushrooms provide vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol); targets foods providing essential brain supporting vitamins: D (UV-exposed mushrooms; fortified plant milks/yogurts)
- Cooking may enhance some nutrient bioavailability
- Include in diverse plant food rotation; dietary diversity (≥30 plant foods per week) supports microbial richness and resilience
- UV-grown mushrooms mentioned as functional food innovation
