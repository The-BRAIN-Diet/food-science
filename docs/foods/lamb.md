## Overview

Lamb provides creatine, heme iron, and complete high-quality protein, supporting ATP recycling and neurotransmitter synthesis. Creatine: Supports ATP recycling in neurons; enhances working memory and cognitive processing speed; food sources include beef, lamb, pork, salmon, tuna, cod, scallops. Iron (heme & non-heme): Oxygen delivery to brain, dopamine synthesis; food sources include liver, beef, lamb, poultry, fish. Heme iron is 2-3× more bioavailable than non-heme iron.

## Preparation Notes

- Choose grass-fed when possible for better fatty acid profile
- Gentle cooking preserves nutrients and prevents formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs)
- Important for creatine and heme iron intake
- Part of diverse protein strategy
- Supports neurotransmitter synthesis through tryptophan and tyrosine content
