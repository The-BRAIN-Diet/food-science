## Overview

Walnuts provide plant-based omega-3 (ALA), polyphenols, and ellagitannins that can be converted to urolithin A by gut bacteria, supporting mitochondrial health and cognitive function. The Green Mediterranean Diet study showed greater visceral adipose tissue loss that tracked with higher total plasma polyphenols and with the microbiome-derived markers urolithin A (via ellagitannins: walnuts/pomegranate). Walnuts are part of the Mediterranean diet pattern and support BDNF expression through exercise and polyphenol synergy.

## Preparation Notes

- Best consumed raw to preserve omega-3s and prevent oxidation
- Soaking may improve digestibility and reduce antinutrients
- Pair with other omega-3 sources for optimal DHA status (conversion from ALA is limited)
- Higher polyphenol intake and microbial diversity increase urolithin A production from ellagitannins
