## Overview

Walnuts provide plant-based omega-3 (ALA), polyphenols, and ellagitannins that can be converted to urolithin A by gut bacteria, supporting mitochondrial health and cognitive function.

## Key Substances

### Nutrients
- **Alpha-Linolenic Acid (ALA)**: Plant omega-3 (limited conversion to DHA)
- **Protein**: Plant protein source
- **Magnesium**: Mineral cofactor
- **Manganese**: Antioxidant enzyme support

### Bioactive Substances
- **Ellagitannins**: Precursors to urolithin A via gut microbiome
- **Polyphenols**: Antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compounds

## From the paper

- "VAT loss tracked with higher total plasma polyphenols and with the microbiome-derived markers urolithin A (via ellagitannins: walnuts/pomegranate)"
- Mentioned as source of plant-based omega-3
- Part of Mediterranean diet pattern

## Preparation Notes

- Best consumed raw to preserve omega-3s
- Soaking may improve digestibility
- Pair with other omega-3 sources for optimal DHA status
