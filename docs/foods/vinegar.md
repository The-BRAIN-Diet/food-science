## Overview

Vinegar, particularly apple cider vinegar, supports glucose regulation and can be used in bean soaking to optimize pH for phytase enzyme activity.

## Key Substances

### Nutrients
- **Acetic acid**: Primary component

### Bioactive Substances
- **Acetic acid**: May support glucose regulation

## From the paper

- "Glucose Regulation: Low-GI carbs, vinegar, berberine, cinnamon, protein + fibre pairing, meal sequencing (veg → protein → carb)"
- "Add a bit of lemon juice or apple cider vinegar (1–2 tsp per liter of water) to reach ~pH 5.5–6" for optimal bean soaking conditions

## Preparation Notes

- Use in bean soaking to optimize pH for phytate reduction
- May support postprandial glucose control
- Dilute before consumption
- Part of food preparation and glucose management strategies
