## Overview

Vinegar, particularly apple cider vinegar, supports glucose regulation and can be used in bean soaking to optimize pH for phytase enzyme activity. Glucose regulation strategies include low-GI carbs, vinegar, berberine, cinnamon, protein + fibre pairing, and meal sequencing (veg → protein → carb).
