## Overview

Chicken provides complete high-quality protein, niacin (B3) for NAD+ synthesis, zinc, and tryptophan, supporting neurotransmitter synthesis and mitochondrial function. Niacin (Vitamin B3) is directly converted to NAD+ via salvage pathway, and lack of niacin hampers NAD+ regeneration, decreasing ATP production and potentially affecting cognitive performance. Chicken is listed as a niacin-rich food and as a source for tryptophan, which is converted to NAD+ via kynurenine pathway and serves as a serotonin precursor.

## Preparation Notes

- Best prepared with gentle cooking to preserve nutrients and prevent formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs)
- Dark meat provides more taurine, which regulates calcium signaling, antioxidant defense, and neurotransmission
- Part of diverse protein strategy
- Supports NAD+ and neurotransmitter synthesis
- Protein-rich breakfasts support dopamine synthesis; pair with anti-inflammatory nutrients to protect DMN switching
