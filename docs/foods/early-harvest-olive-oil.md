## Overview

Early harvest extra virgin olive oil is a precision food in the BRAIN Diet, harvested from olives picked earlier in the season when they contain significantly higher concentrations of bioactive compounds. **Olive oil's brain benefits come from polyphenols, not fatty acids.** Early harvest oils have substantially higher levels of the key secoiridoids and phenolics that provide brain health benefits:

- **Oleuropein aglycone** → mitophagy, SIRT1, AMPK activation (up to 53-56% more CoQ10 than later harvest)
- **Oleocanthal** → NF-κB inhibition, anti-inflammatory effects
- **Oleacein** → antioxidant, NRF2 activation
- **Tyrosol / Hydroxytyrosol** → neuroprotective effects

These enhanced bioactive levels support mitochondrial function, antioxidant networks, and anti-inflammatory pathways, making early harvest olive oil a valuable component of precision dietary strategies for brain health. The implementation of the BRAIN diet must go beyond a standard nutrient density focus; it's about choosing foods for their specific bioactive potential: early harvest extra virgin olive oil with higher levels of CoQ10, oleuropein, oleocanthal, oleacein, hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol, and total polyphenols.

## Substances

<FoodSubstances details={frontMatter} />

## Preparation Notes

- Best used for salad dressings, drizzling, and low-heat applications to preserve polyphenols and CoQ10
- Avoid high-heat cooking to prevent degradation of bioactive compounds
- Store away from heat and light to preserve antioxidant properties and CoQ10 levels
- Look for harvest date information on labels; early harvest typically occurs in September-October (Northern Hemisphere)
- Total CoQ dropped by 53%-56% between three weeks of the harvesting of two brands, highlighting the critical importance of harvest timing
- Higher polyphenol content provides stronger antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects compared to standard EVOO
