## Overview

Early harvest extra virgin olive oil is a precision food in the BRAIN Diet, harvested from olives picked earlier in the season when they contain significantly higher concentrations of bioactive compounds. Early harvest oils have substantially higher levels of CoQ10 (up to 53-56% more than later harvest), oleuropein, hydroxytyrosol, and total polyphenols compared to standard extra virgin olive oil. These enhanced bioactive levels support mitochondrial function, antioxidant networks, and anti-inflammatory pathways, making early harvest olive oil a valuable component of precision dietary strategies for brain health. The implementation of the BRAIN diet must go beyond a standard nutrient density focus; it's about choosing foods for their specific bioactive potential: early harvest extra virgin olive oil with higher levels of CoQ10, oleuropein and polyphenols.

## Substances

## Preparation Notes

- Best used for salad dressings, drizzling, and low-heat applications to preserve polyphenols and CoQ10
- Avoid high-heat cooking to prevent degradation of bioactive compounds
- Store away from heat and light to preserve antioxidant properties and CoQ10 levels
- Look for harvest date information on labels; early harvest typically occurs in September-October (Northern Hemisphere)
- Total CoQ dropped by 53%-56% between three weeks of the harvesting of two brands, highlighting the critical importance of harvest timing
- Higher polyphenol content provides stronger antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects compared to standard EVOO
