## Overview

Liver is one of the most nutrient-dense foods, providing bioavailable B12, retinol (vitamin A), heme iron, CoQ10, and choline in highly absorbable forms.

## Key Substances

### Nutrients
- **Vitamin B12**: Bioavailable cobalamin for methylation
- **Retinol (Vitamin A)**: Preformed, highly bioavailable
- **Iron**: Heme iron (2-3× more bioavailable than non-heme)
- **Folate (B9)**: Methylation support
- **Choline**: Acetylcholine precursor

### Bioactive Substances
- **CoQ10**: Highest dietary source (up to 12mg/100g)
- **Creatine**: ATP recycling support

## From the paper

- "Grass-fed liver for bioavailable retinol and B12"
- "Organ meats (heart, liver), oily fish (sardines, mackerel), beef" for CoQ10
- "Vitamin B12: Liver, clams, fish, eggs, dairy"
- "Acetylcholine and choline: Egg yolks, fish roe, soy, wheat germ, liver"
- "Occasional offal (Latoch et al. 2024) i.e. liver"

## Preparation Notes

- Source from grass-fed/pasture-raised animals when possible
- Moderate consumption due to high vitamin A content
- Gentle cooking preserves nutrients
- Important for vegan/vegetarian nutrient gap closure
