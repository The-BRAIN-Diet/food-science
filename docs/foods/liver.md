## Overview

Liver is one of the most nutrient-dense foods, providing bioavailable B12, retinol (vitamin A), heme iron, CoQ10, and choline in highly absorbable forms. Organ meats are the highest dietary source of CoQ10 (up to 12mg per 100g). Liver is listed as a source for vitamin B12, retinol, heme iron, choline, and acetylcholine synthesis support. Occasional offal consumption is recommended for nutrient density.

## Preparation Notes

- Source from grass-fed/pasture-raised animals when possible for optimal nutrient profile
- Moderate consumption due to high vitamin A content (retinol can accumulate)
- Gentle cooking preserves nutrients and prevents formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs)
- Important for vegan/vegetarian nutrient gap closure, though not suitable for vegetarians
- Organ meats (heart, liver), oily fish (sardines, mackerel), beef are top sources for CoQ10
