## Overview

Nutritional yeast, especially fortified varieties, provides B12, B6, and nicotinamide riboside (NAD+ precursor), helping close vegan nutrient gaps. Fortified nutritional yeast (B12, B6) helps narrow vegan nutrient gaps, and precision sourcing of functional plant foods such as Mankai duckweed (iron, B12), soy/soy lecithin (choline), and fortified nutritional yeast (B12, B6) is recommended.
