## Overview

Chia seeds provide ALA (plant omega-3), soluble fiber, and minerals, supporting gut health and providing plant-based omega-3. Soluble fibre (from apples, oats, flaxseeds) - chia also provides soluble fiber supporting gut health and SCFA production. ALA is an essential omega-3 fatty acid with limited conversion to DHA/EPA in adults; food sources include flax, chia, and walnuts. Conversion from ALA is less than 5% in most adults; direct DHA/EPA strongly recommended for optimal brain health.

## Substances

<FoodSubstances details={frontMatter} />

## Preparation Notes

- Can be consumed raw, soaked, or in recipes; soaking creates gel-like consistency
- Part of diverse seed intake; dietary diversity (≥30 plant foods per week) supports microbial richness and resilience
- Limited ALA-to-DHA conversion; consider algal DHA for direct omega-3 support; conversion from ALA is less than 5% in most adults
- Supports gut health via soluble fiber; prebiotic fibres support Bifidobacterium, Akkermansia; ↑ butyrate production; improved gut barrier
