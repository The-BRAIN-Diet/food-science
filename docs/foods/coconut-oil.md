## Overview

Coconut oil provides medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) that provide rapid energy for the brain and support ketone production.

## Key Substances

### Nutrients
- **MCTs (C8, C10)**: Medium-chain triglycerides

### Bioactive Substances
- **MCTs**: Rapid energy for brain, supports ketone production

## From the paper

- "Coconut Oil / MCT Oil: MCTs (C8, C10), rapid energy for brain, supports ketone production - Smoothies, baking, small-portion use"
- "Antimicrobial Lipids: Medium-chain triglycerides (MCT oil, coconut oil), caprylic acid - Direct inhibition of pathobionts (Candida, C. difficile) without harming commensals"

## Preparation Notes

- Use in smoothies, baking, or small portions
- Part of MCT strategy for brain energy
- Supports ketone production
