## Overview

Coconut oil provides medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) that provide rapid energy for the brain and support ketone production. MCTs (C8, C10) are converted to ketones (beta-hydroxybutyrate), which serve as an alternative energy substrate for mitochondria, supporting mitochondrial function especially when glucose metabolism is impaired. The ATP produced from ketone metabolism supports neurotransmitter synthesis, indirectly supporting neurochemical balance. Coconut Oil / MCT Oil provides MCTs (C8, C10), rapid energy for brain, supports ketone production, and can be used in smoothies, baking, or small-portion use.
