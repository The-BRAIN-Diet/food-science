## Overview

Tuna provides omega-3 fatty acids, niacin (B3) for NAD+ synthesis, selenium, creatine for ATP recycling, and high-quality complete protein. Tuna has a DIAAS score of 104-106, indicating high protein quality. Niacin (Vitamin B3) is directly converted to NAD+ via salvage pathway, and lack of niacin hampers NAD+ regeneration, decreasing ATP production and potentially affecting cognitive performance. Creatine supports ATP recycling in neurons and enhances working memory and cognitive processing speed.

## Preparation Notes

- Choose smaller species (skipjack) to reduce mercury exposure; larger species accumulate more heavy metals
- Light/gentle cooking preserves creatine levels; excessive heat can reduce creatine significantly
- Best prepared with gentle cooking methods to preserve omega-3s and prevent oxidation
- Part of diverse fish intake strategy
- Supports NAD+, creatine availability, and mitochondrial function
