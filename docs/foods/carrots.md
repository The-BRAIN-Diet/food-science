## Overview

Carrots provide beta-carotene (vitamin A precursor), demonstrating important food matrix effects where only 1-3% of beta-carotene in raw carrots is accessible for absorption. The bioaccessibility of carotenoids in vegetables is remarkably low—only 1-3% of the β-carotene in raw carrots is accessible for absorption. Practical pairings: spinach + eggs, tomatoes + olive oil, salad + oil, carrots + tahini, kale + avocado, berries + yogurt/nuts. Carotenoids are abundant in leafy greens, orange and yellow vegetables, corn, and egg yolks.

## Preparation Notes

- Cooking and fat pairing enhance beta-carotene absorption; co-consuming a small amount of unsaturated fat improves micelle formation and chylomicron packaging, increasing carotenoid and fat-soluble vitamin absorption
- Pair with fat (tahini, olive oil, avocado) for optimal absorption; practical pairings: carrots + tahini
- Part of diverse vegetable intake; dietary diversity (≥30 plant foods per week) supports microbial richness and resilience
- Supports carotenoid diversity; carotenoids play a neuroprotective role through their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties
