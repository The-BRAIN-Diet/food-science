## Overview

Carrots provide beta-carotene (vitamin A precursor), demonstrating important food matrix effects where only 1-3% of beta-carotene in raw carrots is accessible for absorption.

## Key Substances

### Nutrients

- **Beta-carotene**: Vitamin A precursor
- **Fiber**: Prebiotic fiber
- **Potassium**: Electrolyte

### Bioactive Substances

- **Carotenoids**: Beta-carotene for antioxidant and vitamin A support

## From the paper

- "The bioaccessibility of carotenoids in vegetables is remarkably low, only 1-3% of the β-carotene in raw carrots is accessible for absorption"
- "Practical pairings: spinach + eggs, tomatoes + olive oil, salad + oil, carrots + tahini, kale + avocado, berries + yogurt/nuts"
- "Carotenoids are abundant in leafy greens, orange and yellow vegetables, corn, and egg yolks"

## Preparation Notes

- Cooking and fat pairing enhance beta-carotene absorption
- Pair with fat (tahini, olive oil, avocado) for optimal absorption
- Part of diverse vegetable intake
- Supports carotenoid diversity
