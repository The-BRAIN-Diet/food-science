## Overview

Soy lecithin is a concentrated source of choline, supporting phosphatidylcholine synthesis and LPC-DHA transport for brain delivery.

## Key Substances

### Nutrients
- **Choline**: High concentration for PC synthesis

### Bioactive Substances
- **Phosphatidylcholine**: Carrier for DHA/EPA

## From the paper

- "Precision sourcing of functional plant foods such as Mankai duckweed (iron, B12), soy/soy lecithin (choline), and fortified nutritional yeast (B12, B6)"
- "Vegans should ensure adequate choline intake (e.g., soy or sunflower lecithin, soy foods, quinoa, broccoli) to support phosphatidylcholine synthesis and downstream LPC-DHA transport for brain delivery"

## Preparation Notes

- Available as supplement or food additive
- Important for vegan choline intake
- Supports phospholipid-bound omega-3 strategy
- Part of functional food approach
