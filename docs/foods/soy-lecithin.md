## Overview

Soy lecithin is a concentrated source of choline, supporting phosphatidylcholine synthesis and LPC-DHA transport for brain delivery. Precision sourcing of functional plant foods such as Mankai duckweed (iron, B12), soy/soy lecithin (choline), and fortified nutritional yeast (B12, B6) is recommended.
