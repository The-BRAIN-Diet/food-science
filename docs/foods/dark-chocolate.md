## Overview

Dark chocolate (70%+ cocoa) provides flavanols and polyphenols that support cognitive function, though heavy metal content increases with cocoa percentage. Polyphenol sources include berries, green tea catechins, cocoa flavanols, cranberries, and pomegranate. While dark chocolate has high antioxidants, heavy-metals increase with cocoa content; adding milk content raises available Ca/Zn to reduce intestinal absorption of cadmium and lead.

## Preparation Notes

- Choose 70%+ cocoa for higher flavanol content
- Consider higher-milk/lower-cocoa options to reduce heavy metal absorption
- Select low-Cd/Pb origins with strong post-harvest controls
- Pair with calcium/zinc sources to reduce metal absorption
