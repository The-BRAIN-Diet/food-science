## Overview

Dark chocolate (70%+ cocoa) provides flavanols and polyphenols that support cognitive function, though heavy metal content increases with cocoa percentage.

## Key Substances

### Nutrients
- **Magnesium**: Mineral cofactor
- **Iron**: Non-heme iron
- **Zinc**: When milk content added

### Bioactive Substances
- **Cocoa flavanols**: Polyphenols supporting cognitive function
- **Polyphenols**: Antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compounds
- **Resveratrol**: In some varieties, activates SIRT1

## From the paper

- "Polyphenol Sources: Berries, green tea catechins, cocoa flavanols, cranberries, pomegranate"
- "Polyphenols (e.g., resveratrol): Grapes, blueberries, cranberries, peanuts, dark chocolate"
- "Cortisol-lowering foods (dark chocolate, green tea, omega-3s)"
- "While dark chocolate has high antioxidants, heavy-metals increase with cocoa content; adding milk content raises available Ca/Zn to reduce intestinal absorption of cadmium and lead"
- "Heavy metals... are high in chocolate from central and south America"

## Preparation Notes

- Choose 70%+ cocoa for higher flavanol content
- Consider higher-milk/lower-cocoa options to reduce heavy metal absorption
- Select low-Cd/Pb origins with strong post-harvest controls
- Pair with calcium/zinc sources to reduce metal absorption
