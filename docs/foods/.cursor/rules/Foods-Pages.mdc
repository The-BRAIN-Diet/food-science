globs: *.md

---

- Tag each food page with the substances it contains
- Tag the page with "Food" too, so that it appears in index.md.
- In the front matter, list_image: /img/icons/ingredients.svg
- The title of the page should be a tag on page that exactly matches the title.
- Do not tag food pages with Biological Targets.
- Tag food pages with the substances that the food contains, and tag the substances with the foods they are contained in.

The Format of the page should have this structure:

- Image: Images of the food
- Overview: A single paragraph description describing food, where it comes from, main health benefits etc.
- Recipes: Use the <TagList tag="food tag" filter="recipes" /> here.
- Substances: Use the <TagList tag="food tag" filter="substances" /> here.
- Preparation Notes: From paper.txt any tips on how best to prepare the food for maximum impact.
- Biological Target Matrix: Should be <FoodMatrix tag="food tag" />
- References: A list of findings or scientific principles, with their link to the `/docs/papers/BRAIN-Diet-References#<ref>` that discusses it, from paper.txt in the root directory. Make sure all assertions are backed up by evidence from the paper.txt file . Use references if the paper mentions them.

An example for the references section might look like this:

- A decreased microbial diversity (alpha diversity) has also been reported in ADHD [Prehn-Kristensen et al. 2018](/docs/papers/BRAIN-Diet-References#prehn-kristensen_reduced_2018)

Use the `algal-oil.md` page as an example.
