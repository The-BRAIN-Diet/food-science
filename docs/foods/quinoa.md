## Overview

Quinoa is a pseudograin providing complete plant protein, magnesium, and when fermented in sourdough, can produce GABA through specific bacterial strains. Quinoa has a DIAAS score of 83-87, indicating high protein quality with complete amino acid profile (lysine marginal). Quinoa sourdough offers both very high nutrients (due to the quinoa) and a high GABA profile. Quinoa is mentioned as a source for choline support, important for vegans.

## Substances

<FoodSubstances details={frontMatter} />

## Preparation Notes

- Rinse before cooking to remove saponins (bitter compounds)
- Can be used in sourdough fermentation for GABA production; pseudo grains like quinoa, amaranth etc can introduce GABA and other important brain nutrients
- Pair with legumes to boost lysine content; combine with legumes to boost lysine for complete amino acid profile
- Part of grain-legume complementarity strategy
- Vegans should ensure adequate choline intake (e.g., soy or sunflower lecithin, soy foods, quinoa, broccoli) to support phosphatidylcholine synthesis
