## Overview

Quinoa is a pseudograin providing complete plant protein, magnesium, and when fermented in sourdough, can produce GABA through specific bacterial strains.

## Key Substances

### Nutrients
- **Protein**: DIAAS 83-87, complete amino acid profile (lysine marginal)
- **Magnesium**: Cofactor for 300+ enzymatic reactions
- **Fiber**: Prebiotic fiber
- **B Vitamins**: B6 mentioned

### Bioactive Substances
- **GABA**: Produced in quinoa sourdough by Levilactobacillus brevis CRL 2013

## From the paper

- "Quinoa sourdough... offers both very high nutrients (due to the quinoa) and a high GABA profile"
- "Pseudo Grains: Quinoa, amaranth etc can introduce GABA and other important brain nutrients"
- DIAAS 83-87, lysine marginal; "Complete plant protein, magnesium-rich"
- "Quinoa" mentioned as source for choline support
- "Combine with legumes to boost lysine"

## Preparation Notes

- Rinse before cooking to remove saponins
- Can be used in sourdough fermentation for GABA production
- Pair with legumes for complete amino acid profile
