## Overview

Ginger provides gingerols with gut-brain axis support, anti-inflammatory effects, and prokinetic properties helpful for SIBO management. Ginger supports gut-brain axis support and anti-inflammatory effects at 1–2 g/day fresh or powdered root, and many members of the Zingiberaceae family (which includes ginger, turmeric, and galangal) have pleiotropic effects overlapping between metabolic regulation and neurocognitive outcomes.
