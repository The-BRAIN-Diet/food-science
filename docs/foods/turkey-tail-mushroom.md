## Overview

Turkey Tail mushroom (Trametes versicolor) is a common medicinal mushroom found worldwide, recognized by its colorful, banded appearance resembling a turkey's tail. It is particularly rich in polysaccharides, including polysaccharide-K (PSK) and polysaccharide-peptide (PSP), which have been extensively studied for their immune-modulating properties. Turkey Tail supports gut microbiome diversity and may help modulate immune responses. It is one of the most researched medicinal mushrooms for immune support and is commonly consumed as a tea, extract, or supplement.
