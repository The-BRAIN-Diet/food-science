## Overview

Salmon roe (fish eggs) provides omega-3 fatty acids in phospholipid-bound form, which enhances brain delivery compared to triglyceride forms. It provides DHA, EPA, phospholipids, choline, and astaxanthin with high bioavailability and zero oxidation risk. Studies show phospholipid-bound omega-3s such as krill oil and fish roe provide EPA/DHA in a phospholipid form that gets easily converted to lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), which was 1.9-fold more efficacious for brain gray matter DHA accretion in porcine models compared to triglyceride forms.

## Preparation Notes

- Best consumed cold/raw (sushi, spoonful daily) to preserve phospholipid structure
- Avoid cooking to preserve phospholipid structure and prevent oxidation
- Zero oxidation risk when fresh
- DHA or EPA incorporated into PC and converted into lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) crosses the blood-brain barrier far more efficiently than free fatty acid or triglyceride-bound forms [Patrick 2019](/docs/papers/BRAIN-Diet-References#patrick_role_2019)
