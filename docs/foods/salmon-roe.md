## Overview

Salmon roe (fish eggs) provides omega-3 fatty acids in phospholipid-bound form, which enhances brain delivery compared to triglyceride forms. It provides DHA, EPA, phospholipids, choline, and astaxanthin with high bioavailability and zero oxidation risk. Studies show phospholipid-bound omega-3s such as krill oil and fish roe provide EPA/DHA in a phospholipid form that gets easily converted to lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), which was 1.9-fold more efficacious for brain gray matter DHA accretion in porcine models compared to triglyceride forms.

### Astaxanthin (naturally occurring)

Salmon roe contains astaxanthin, a lipid-soluble carotenoid that contributes to the stability of omega-3–rich membranes. In food matrices such as roe, astaxanthin helps limit oxidative stress associated with highly unsaturated fats and supports mitochondrial and cellular resilience.

## Vitamins & Minerals

Salmon roe is exceptionally rich in essential vitamins and minerals. It is one of the best dietary sources of **vitamin B12**, providing over 330% of the daily value per 100 grams. Salmon roe is also an excellent source of **vitamin D** (58% DV), supporting immune function and calcium homeostasis. It provides substantial amounts of **selenium** (94% DV) for antioxidant enzyme function, **magnesium** (75% DV) for neurotransmitter synthesis and mitochondrial function, and **iron** (66% DV) for oxygen transport and dopamine synthesis. Additional B vitamins include choline (45% DV), pantothenic acid (B5), riboflavin (B2), pyridoxine (B6), and folate. Salmon roe also provides **calcium** (28% DV), **vitamin E** (13% DV), and **phosphorus** (39% DV), making it one of the most nutrient-dense foods available.

## Preparation Notes

- Best consumed cold/raw (sushi, spoonful daily) to preserve phospholipid structure
- Avoid cooking to preserve phospholipid structure and prevent oxidation
- Zero oxidation risk when fresh
- DHA or EPA incorporated into PC and converted into lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) crosses the blood-brain barrier far more efficiently than free fatty acid or triglyceride-bound forms [Patrick 2019](/docs/papers/BRAIN-Diet-References#patrick_role_2019)
