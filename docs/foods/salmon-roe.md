## Overview

Salmon roe (fish eggs) provides omega-3 fatty acids in phospholipid-bound form, which enhances brain delivery compared to triglyceride forms. Also rich in choline, astaxanthin, and other bioactives.

## Key Substances

### Nutrients
- **Omega-3 (EPA/DHA)**: In phospholipid form for enhanced BBB transport
- **Choline**: Supports acetylcholine synthesis and membrane health
- **Protein**: High-quality complete protein

### Bioactive Substances
- **Astaxanthin**: Powerful carotenoid antioxidant
- **Phosphatidylcholine**: Carrier for DHA/EPA to brain

## From the paper

- "Salmon Roe: DHA, EPA, phospholipids, choline, astaxanthin; highly bioavailable; zero oxidation risk"
- "Targeted foods such as salmon or lumpfish roe can be used to reliably and safely exceed minimum intakes"
- "Phospholipid-bound omega-3s (e.g., krill oil, fish roe) may enhance brain delivery; lysophosphatidylcholine-DHA is a known transport species to the brain"

## Preparation Notes

- Best consumed cold/raw (sushi, spoonful daily)
- Avoid cooking to preserve phospholipid structure
- Zero oxidation risk when fresh
