## Overview

Cocoa provides flavanols (polyphenols) that support cognitive function, though heavy metal content increases with cocoa percentage. Polyphenol Sources: Berries, green tea catechins, cocoa flavanols, cranberries, pomegranate; ↑ Faecalibacterium, Roseburia; inhibit Enterobacteriaceae; reduce NF-κB activation. Cocoa flavanols support cognitive function and vascular health.

## Substances

## Preparation Notes

- Choose low-Cd/Pb origins with strong post-harvest controls to minimize heavy metal exposure
- Higher cocoa content = higher heavy metals; be mindful of cadmium and lead content
- Part of diverse polyphenol intake strategy; dietary diversity (≥30 plant foods per week) supports microbial richness and resilience
- Supports cognitive function through flavanol content; polyphenol sources support gut barrier integrity, TLR4 suppression, LPS neutralization, and microglial activation dampening
