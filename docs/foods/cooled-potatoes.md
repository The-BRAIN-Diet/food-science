## Overview

Potatoes that are cooked and then cooled develop resistant starch through retrogradation, providing prebiotic fiber that supports gut microbiome and SCFA production.

## Key Substances

### Nutrients
- **Resistant Starch**: Forms when cooked and cooled (retrogradation)
- **Potassium**: Electrolyte
- **Vitamin C**: When fresh
- **B6**: Neurotransmitter cofactor

## From the paper

- "Resistant starch (cooled potatoes, green bananas)"
- "The complex carbohydrate, Resistant Starch, forms when certain starchy foods are cooked and then cooled, a process called retrogradation. Foods like rice and potatoes develop higher resistant starch content when chilled"
- "White rice was cooled and reheated showing a rise in RS content from 0.64 to 1.65 g/100 g and elicited a lower glycemic response"
- "B6(chickpeas, potatoes, bananas, whole grains, soy)"

## Preparation Notes

- Cook potatoes, then cool (refrigerate) to form resistant starch
- Reheating does not reverse resistant starch formation
- Supports butyrate production via gut fermentation
- Lower glycemic response compared to hot potatoes
