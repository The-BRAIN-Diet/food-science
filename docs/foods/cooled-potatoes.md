## Overview

Potatoes that are cooked and then cooled develop resistant starch through retrogradation, providing prebiotic fiber that supports gut microbiome and SCFA production. The complex carbohydrate, Resistant Starch, forms when certain starchy foods are cooked and then cooled, a process called retrogradation. Foods like rice and potatoes develop higher resistant starch content when chilled. White rice was cooled and reheated showing a rise in RS content from 0.64 to 1.65 g/100 g and elicited a lower glycemic response.

## Preparation Notes

- Cook potatoes, then cool (refrigerate) to form resistant starch; resistant starch forms when certain starchy foods are cooked and then cooled, a process called retrogradation
- Reheating does not reverse resistant starch formation; white rice was cooled and reheated showing a rise in RS content from 0.64 to 1.65 g/100 g and elicited a lower glycemic response
- Supports butyrate production via gut fermentation; resistant starch (cooled potatoes, green bananas) supports Bifidobacterium, Akkermansia; ↑ butyrate production; improved gut barrier
- Lower glycemic response compared to hot potatoes; blunts post-prandial glycemic excursions
