## Overview

Purple potatoes provide anthocyanins, particularly C3G (cyanidin-3-glucoside), that serve as natural chelation agents for heavy metals and support neuroprotection. Anthocyanins, especially C3G-rich sources like berries, purple potatoes, and black goji, serve as natural chelation agents for heavy metals and environmental contaminants, neuroprotective molecules that support synaptic resilience and detox pathways, and detox allies against microplastics and hormone-disrupting pollutants.
