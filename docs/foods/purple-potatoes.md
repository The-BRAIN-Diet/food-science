description: Anthocyanins (C3G) for heavy metal chelation and neuroprotection
---

## Overview

Purple potatoes provide anthocyanins, particularly C3G (cyanidin-3-glucoside), that serve as natural chelation agents for heavy metals and support neuroprotection.

## Key Substances

### Nutrients
- **Resistant Starch**: When cooked and cooled
- **Potassium**: Electrolyte
- **Vitamin C**: Some content

### Bioactive Substances
- **Anthocyanins (C3G)**: Cyanidin-3-glucoside for metal chelation and neuroprotection
- **Polyphenols**: Antioxidant compounds

## From the paper

- "Anthocyanins, especially C3G-rich sources like berries, purple potatoes, and black goji, serve as: Natural chelation agents for heavy metals and environmental contaminants; Neuroprotective molecules that support synaptic resilience and detox pathways; Detox allies against microplastics and hormone-disrupting pollutants"

## Preparation Notes

- Can form resistant starch when cooked and cooled
- Part of diverse polyphenol intake
- Supports detoxification pathways
- Pair with other C3G-rich foods
