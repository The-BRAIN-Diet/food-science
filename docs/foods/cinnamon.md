## Overview

Cinnamon is a spice containing bioactive polyphenols and compounds that support glycemic control, insulin sensitivity, and cognitive function, relevant for ADHD metabolic dysregulation. Cinnamon is extremely high in polyphenols, with procyanidins being a major component, and cinnamaldehyde as the key aromatic compound that contributes to its characteristic flavor and many health benefits.

## Nutrient & Bioactive Table (per 100 g dry ground cinnamon)

| Compound / Nutrient | Approx Amount / 100 g | Notes / References |
|---------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Calories | ~247 kcal | Common nutrition data |
| Total Carbohydrate | ~80 g | Majority is fiber |
| Dietary Fiber | ~53 g | Very high fiber content |
| Protein | ~4 g | Minimal protein |
| Fat | ~1 g | Minimal fat |
| Calcium | ~1002 mg | ~77% DV equivalent |
| Iron | ~8.3 mg | ~46% DV |
| Magnesium | ~60 mg | ~14% DV |
| Manganese | ~17.5 mg | ~759% DV |
| Copper | ~0.3 mg | ~38% DV |
| Potassium | ~431 mg | ~11% DV |
| Zinc | ~1.8 mg | ~13% DV |
| Polyphenols (total) | ~~9,000+ mg (est.) | Cinnamon bark is extremely high in polyphenols; procyanidins ~8108 mg/100 g reported for bark |
| Cinnamaldehyde (key aromatic) | Not in standard nutrition tables | Major volatile compound; most cinnamon essential oils ~60–80% cinnamaldehyde |
| Cinnamic acid | Not in standard tables | Present in bark and extracts; requires analytical quantification |
| Procyanidins (Type A & B) | Not in standard tables | High levels of proanthocyanidins (polymerised flavonoids) reported in bark |
| Coumarin | Variable (species dependent) | Cassia: ~1.7–9.3 mg/g (so ~1700–9300 mg/100 g) very high vs Ceylon: ~0.005–0.09 mg/g very low |
| Volatile oils (e.g., eugenol, linalool, caryophyllene) | Not in standard tables | Present but vary widely; typically quantified via essential oil analysis |

**Notes on Interpretation:** Polyphenol estimates indicate cinnamon is extremely high in phenolic compounds, often cited as one of the highest among common spices. Bioactives like cinnamaldehyde and procyanidins are not part of standard nutrition databases and require analytical chemistry studies for quantification. Coumarin content is especially high in Cassia cinnamon, which matters for toxicity limits. Ceylon cinnamon has far lower coumarin.

## Preparation Notes

- Can be used in culinary amounts or therapeutic doses
- Ceylon cinnamon preferred over cassia for lower coumarin
- Part of glucose regulation strategy
- Supports insulin sensitivity
