## Overview

Reishi mushroom (Ganoderma lucidum), known in China as Ling Zhi, is a medicinal mushroom with a long-standing reputation as a tonic for vitality. Unlike stimulants such as caffeine, Reishi works quietly and cumulatively, supporting the foundations of energy, resilience, and emotional steadiness. Modern research links these effects largely to its polysaccharides, alongside other bioactive compounds that help modulate stress and immune balance—key influences on long-term vitality. Traditionally reserved for emperors and scholars, Reishi is valued not for quick stimulation but for its ability to restore depleted reserves and support recovery and balance.
