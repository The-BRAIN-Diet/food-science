## Overview

Amaranth is a pseudograin providing complete plant protein and, when used in functional flours, can introduce GABA and other brain nutrients through fermentation. Pseudo grains such as quinoa and amaranth can introduce GABA and other important brain nutrients, and the fermentation of quinoa flour, and other functional flours, introduces natural GABA.
