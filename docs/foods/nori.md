## Overview

Nori is a red seaweed (Porphyra species) commonly used in sushi and Japanese cuisine. It is a primary dietary source of iodine, an essential trace mineral critical for thyroid function and brain development. Nori also provides supporting amounts of folate (B9) and non-heme iron, along with contextual contributions of magnesium, vitamin K, and carotenoids. While nori may contain variable amounts of vitamin B12 depending on species and processing, it should not be relied upon as a sole B12 source. The seaweed polysaccharides and soluble fibre in nori contribute to gut barrier and microbiome modulation through cumulative, supportive effects.

## Preparation Notes

- Commonly used in sushi rolls and as a garnish
- Part of diverse plant food intake strategy
- Important for iodine intake, especially in plant-based diets
- Folate and iron contributions are context-dependent and work best as part of a varied diet
- Seaweed polysaccharides provide cumulative gut health benefits when consumed regularly

- Iodine: Primary dietary source; essential for thyroid function and brain development
- Folate (B9): Supporting contributor for one-carbon metabolism and homocysteine regulation
- Iron (non-heme): Supporting contributor for oxygen delivery; absorption is context-dependent
- Seaweed polysaccharides: Supporting contributor for gut barrier and microbiome modulation (cumulative effects)
- Vitamin B12: Variable and context-dependent; should not be relied upon as sole source
- Magnesium, Vitamin K, Carotenoids: Contextual contributors; modest amounts at typical servings
- Creatine and creatine-pathway amino acids: Presence only (trace); not functionally meaningful at typical intake
