## Overview

Maitake mushroom (Grifola frondosa), also known as "hen of the woods," is a medicinal mushroom valued for its immune-supporting properties. It is particularly rich in beta-glucans, with the D-fraction being a well-studied extract that has shown immune-modulating effects in research. Maitake contains polysaccharides that may support immune cell function and help modulate inflammatory responses. The mushroom is also valued for its culinary properties, with a rich, earthy flavor and meaty texture. Maitake may support blood sugar regulation and metabolic health through its bioactive compounds.
