## Overview

Buckwheat is a pseudograin providing complete plant protein, rutin (flavonoid), and magnesium, supporting vascular health and neurotransmitter function. Buckwheat has a DIAAS score of 75-80, lysine marginal; high rutin content for vascular health. Whole grains (including pseudograins like quinoa and buckwheat, grains like barley and oats) support gut health. Combine with lentils or chickpeas for amino acid complementarity.
