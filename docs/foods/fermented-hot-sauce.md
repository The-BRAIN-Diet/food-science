## Overview

Fermented hot sauce is made by fermenting chilli peppers (often with garlic, salt, and sometimes other vegetables) before blending into a pourable sauce. As with other fermented vegetable products, the fermentation step produces organic acids and flavour compounds; many versions are unpasteurised and used in small amounts as a condiment on otherwise whole-food meals.
