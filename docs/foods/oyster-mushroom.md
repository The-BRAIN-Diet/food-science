## Overview

Oyster mushroom (Pleurotus ostreatus) is a popular culinary mushroom valued for its mild flavor, meaty texture, and nutritional benefits. It is rich in beta-glucans, polysaccharides that support immune function, and provides B vitamins including niacin (B3), which supports NAD+ synthesis and mitochondrial function. Oyster mushrooms are widely cultivated and used in cooking, offering a versatile plant-based protein source. The mushroom contains lovastatin, a compound that has been studied for its potential cardiovascular benefits, and its beta-glucan content contributes to immune-modulating properties similar to other medicinal mushrooms.
