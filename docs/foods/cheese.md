## Overview

Cheese is fermented dairy providing calcium, complete protein, and in some varieties (like Parmesan), vitamin K2 and CLA. Studies have shown that hard cheeses with high calcium do not raise serum LDL levels. Cheese provides tyrosine for dopamine synthesis and supports bone health through calcium and K2 content.

## Preparation Notes

- Choose quality sources when possible; grass-fed/pasture-raised sources may have better nutrient profiles
- Part of diverse dairy intake strategy
- Supports calcium and protein goals; hard cheeses with high calcium do not raise serum LDL levels [Soerensen et al. 2014](/docs/papers/BRAIN-Diet-References#soerensen_effect_2014)
- Consider fermentation benefits; fermented foods provide live microbes + postbiotic peptides; improved SCFA pools; vagal signaling
