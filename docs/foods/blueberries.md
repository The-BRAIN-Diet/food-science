## Overview

Blueberries are rich in polyphenols, particularly anthocyanins, that support cognitive function, antioxidant networks, and may enhance BDNF expression when combined with exercise. Exercise-induced BDNF surges can be potentiated by polyphenols (e.g., blueberries, green tea). Blueberries are part of polyphenol-rich patterns that enhance endogenous antioxidant networks and support microbiome diversity.

## Substances

<FoodSubstances details={frontMatter} />

## Preparation Notes

- Best consumed fresh or frozen to preserve polyphenol content
- Pair with exercise for BDNF synergy; exercise + omega-3 + polyphenol synergy boosts BDNF expression
- Part of diverse polyphenol intake strategy; dietary diversity (≥30 plant foods per week) supports microbial richness and resilience
- Polyphenol sources including berries increase Faecalibacterium and Roseburia; inhibit Enterobacteriaceae; reduce NF-κB activation
