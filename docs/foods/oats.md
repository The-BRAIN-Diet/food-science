## Overview

Oats provide beta-glucan fiber (prebiotic), tryptophan, B vitamins, and complex carbohydrates that support gut health, serotonin synthesis, and stable glucose release. Beta-glucans are prebiotic fibers that support gut microbiome health. Oats are listed as a source for tryptophan, which serves as a serotonin precursor and can be converted to NAD+ via kynurenine pathway. Clinical trials have shown a doubling of plasma levels after dietary increases in oat bran due to its rich phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) content, which supports endocannabinoid system tone.

## Preparation Notes

- Soak overnight to reduce phytates and improve mineral bioavailability
- Pair with tryptophan-rich proteins for serotonin synthesis; pair tryptophan-rich proteins with moderate carbs to increase Trp:LNAA ratio
- Best consumed in evening for calming effect; timing midday or evening for calming effect
- Part of grain-legume complementarity strategy; grains (typically lysine-limited) and legumes (methionine/cysteine-limited) complete each other's profiles when paired
- Tryptophan + complex carbohydrates aid serotonin conversion to melatonin; examples include pumpkin seeds + oats
