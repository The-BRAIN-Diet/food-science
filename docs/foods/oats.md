## Overview

Oats provide beta-glucan fiber (prebiotic), tryptophan, B vitamins, and complex carbohydrates that support gut health, serotonin synthesis, and stable glucose release.

## Key Substances

### Nutrients

- **Beta-glucans**: Prebiotic fiber for gut microbiome
- **Tryptophan**: Serotonin precursor
- **B Vitamins**: B6 mentioned
- **Magnesium**: Cofactor for neurotransmitter pathways
- **Complex carbohydrates**: Slow glucose release

## From the paper

- "Beta-glucans: Oats, barley, mushrooms"
- "Tryptophan: Turkey, chicken, eggs, pumpkin seeds, oats, soybeans"
- "Serotonin: Turkey, eggs, dairy, soy, seeds, oats, bananas"
- "Tryptophan + complex carbs (pumpkin seeds + oats)" for sleep support
- "Soluble fibre (from apples, oats, flaxseeds)"
- "Whole grains (including... grains like barley and oats)"

## Preparation Notes

- Soak overnight to reduce phytates
- Pair with tryptophan-rich proteins for serotonin synthesis
- Best consumed in evening for calming effect
- Part of grain-legume complementarity strategy
