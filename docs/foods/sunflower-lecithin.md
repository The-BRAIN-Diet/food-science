## Overview

Sunflower lecithin provides choline for phosphatidylcholine synthesis, offering a soy-free alternative for those avoiding soy. Vegans should ensure adequate choline intake (e.g., soy or sunflower lecithin, soy foods, quinoa, broccoli) to support phosphatidylcholine synthesis and downstream LPC-DHA transport for brain delivery.
