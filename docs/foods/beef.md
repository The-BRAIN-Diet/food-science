description: High creatine, CoQ10, heme iron, and complete protein
---

## Overview

Beef provides high levels of creatine, CoQ10, heme iron (2-3× more bioavailable), and complete high-quality protein, supporting ATP recycling and neurotransmitter synthesis.

## Key Substances

### Nutrients
- **Creatine**: High levels for ATP recycling
- **CoQ10**: Mitochondrial support
- **Iron**: Heme iron (2-3× more bioavailable than non-heme)
- **Zinc**: Neurotransmitter modulation
- **Protein**: Complete amino acid profile (DIAAS 108-110)

## From the paper

- "Creatine: Beef, lamb, pork, salmon, tuna, cod, scallops"
- "Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10): Organ meats (heart, liver), oily fish (sardines, mackerel), beef"
- "Iron(heme & non-heme): Liver, beef, lamb, poultry, fish"
- "Zinc: Oysters, beef, crab, chicken, pork"
- DIAAS 108-110, "High creatine, iron, zinc"

## Preparation Notes

- Choose grass-fed when possible for better fatty acid profile
- Gentle cooking preserves nutrients
- Important for creatine and heme iron intake
- Part of diverse protein strategy
