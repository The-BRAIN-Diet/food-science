## Overview

Cockles are small bivalve shellfish that provide a nutrient-dense source of vitamin B12, iron, zinc, and selenium, along with marine taurine and phospholipid-bound omega-3 fatty acids. Like mussels and other bivalves, cockles contribute to neurotransmitter synthesis and energy metabolism. Their natural liquor (released when steamed) contains amino acids, minerals, and peptides that add both flavour and nutritional value. Cockles are a sustainable shellfish option with a low carbon footprint when farmed or wild-harvested responsibly.
