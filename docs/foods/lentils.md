## Overview

Lentils are a staple legume in the BRAIN Diet, providing plant protein, fiber, folate, iron, and prebiotic compounds that support gut health and neurotransmitter synthesis.

## Key Substances

### Nutrients
- **Protein**: DIAAS 65-70, methionine/cysteine-limited (pair with grains)
- **Fiber**: Prebiotic fiber for gut microbiome
- **Folate (B9)**: Critical for methylation and neurotransmitter synthesis
- **Iron**: Non-heme iron (enhance with vitamin C)
- **Magnesium**: Cofactor for neurotransmitter pathways

### Bioactive Substances
- **Polyphenols**: Antioxidant compounds

## From the paper

- Listed as plant protein source (DIAAS 65-70)
- "Lentils" mentioned as source of fiber, folate, iron
- Part of grain-legume complementarity strategy
- Source of prebiotic fiber (GOS)

## Preparation Notes

- Soak and cook thoroughly to reduce phytates
- Pair with grains for complete amino acid profile
- Pair with vitamin C sources to enhance iron absorption
