## Overview

Lentils are a staple legume in the BRAIN Diet, providing plant protein, fiber, folate, iron, and prebiotic compounds that support gut health and neurotransmitter synthesis. Lentils have a DIAAS score of 65-70, indicating they are methionine/cysteine-limited and should be paired with grains for complete amino acid profile. Lentils are listed as sources for iron, zinc, and glutamate synthesis, supporting neurotransmitter pathways.

## Substances

<FoodSubstances details={frontMatter} />

## Preparation Notes

- Soak and cook thoroughly to reduce phytates and improve mineral bioavailability; soaking and sprouting reduces phytates in legumes/grains, improving non-heme iron and zinc bioavailability
- Pair with grains for complete amino acid profile; grain-legume complementarity improves essential amino-acid coverage
- Pair with vitamin C sources to enhance iron absorption, with studies showing up to a fourfold increase when consumed together [Hallberg et al. 1989](/docs/papers/BRAIN-Diet-References#hallberg_iron_1989)
- Source of prebiotic fiber (GOS - galactooligosaccharides) supporting gut microbiome health
