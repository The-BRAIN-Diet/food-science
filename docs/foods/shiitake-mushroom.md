## Overview

Shiitake mushroom (Lentinula edodes) is both a popular culinary mushroom and a valued medicinal food. It is rich in beta-glucans, polysaccharides that support immune function, and provides a rich umami flavor to dishes. Shiitake contains eritadenine, a compound that may support cardiovascular health, and is a good source of B vitamins including niacin (B3), which supports NAD+ synthesis and mitochondrial function. The mushroom also contains lentinan, a beta-glucan that has been studied for its immune-modulating properties. Shiitake is widely used in cooking and can be consumed fresh or dried.
