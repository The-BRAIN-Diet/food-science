## Overview

Spirulina is a microalgae providing protein, antioxidants, and phycocyanin, but contains pseudovitamin B12 analogues that are inactive in humans. Spirulina has DIAAS 75-83, is methionine and lysine-limited, and contains some bioactive peptides. By contrast, spirulina is dominated by pseudovitamin B12 analogues, which are inactive in humans and therefore unsuitable as a primary B12 source. Nonetheless, both algae provide antioxidant and amino acid support.
