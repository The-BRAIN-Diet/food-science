## Overview

Spirulina is a microalgae providing protein, antioxidants, and phycocyanin, but contains pseudovitamin B12 analogues that are inactive in humans.

## Key Substances

### Nutrients
- **Protein**: DIAAS 75-83, methionine/lysine-limited
- **Iron**: Some content

### Bioactive Substances
- **Phycocyanin**: Antioxidant compound with potential anti-inflammatory effects
- **Antioxidants**: Various compounds

## From the paper

- "Spirulina: DIAAS 75-83, Methionine, lysine - Contains some bioactive peptides"
- "Chlorella contains bioavailable, true vitamin B12 (cobalamin)... By contrast, spirulina is dominated by pseudovitamin B12 analogues, which are inactive in humans and therefore unsuitable as a primary B12 source. Nonetheless, both algae provide antioxidant and amino acid support"

## Preparation Notes

- Not suitable as primary B12 source (contains inactive analogues)
- Provides other beneficial compounds
- Available as powder, tablets, or capsules
- Pair with grains/legumes for amino acid balance
