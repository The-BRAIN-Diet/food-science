## Overview

Milk provides complete high-quality protein (DIAAS 118), nicotinamide riboside (NAD+ precursor), and calcium, supporting mitochondrial function and bone health. Milk (skim) has a DIAAS score of 118, indicating balanced EAA profile and supports myelination. Nicotinamide Riboside: Efficient NAD⁺ precursor with neuroprotective potential - Dairy milk, whey protein, yeast-containing foods (e.g., sourdough bread). Fortified plant milks and dairy milk can help meet calcium (and sometimes iodine, depending on fortification and local practices) targets.
