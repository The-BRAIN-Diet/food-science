## Overview

Milk provides complete high-quality protein (DIAAS 118), nicotinamide riboside (NAD+ precursor), and calcium, supporting mitochondrial function and bone health.

## Key Substances

### Nutrients
- **Protein**: DIAAS 118, complete amino acid profile
- **Calcium**: High content
- **B Vitamins**: Various B vitamins

### Bioactive Substances
- **Nicotinamide Riboside**: Efficient NAD+ precursor

## From the paper

- "Nicotinamide Riboside: Efficient NAD⁺ precursor with neuroprotective potential - Dairy milk, whey protein, yeast-containing foods (e.g., sourdough bread)"
- "Milk (skim): DIAAS 118, None (limiting amino acids) - Balanced EAA profile, supports myelination"
- "Fortified plant milks and dairy milk can help meet calcium (and sometimes iodine, depending on fortification and local practices) targets"

## Preparation Notes

- Choose quality sources when possible
- Part of diverse protein strategy
- Supports NAD+ availability
- Consider tolerance and preferences
