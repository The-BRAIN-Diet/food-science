## Overview

Cordyceps is a medicinal mushroom that has been traditionally used to support energy, endurance, and vitality. The most commonly used species include Cordyceps sinensis and Cordyceps militaris. Cordyceps contains bioactive compounds including cordycepin, polysaccharides, and adenosine, which have been studied for their potential effects on mitochondrial function, oxygen utilization, and energy metabolism. Research suggests Cordyceps may support ATP production and cellular energy pathways, making it of interest for supporting physical performance and energy levels. It is also valued for its potential immune-modulating properties.
