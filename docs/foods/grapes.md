## Overview

Grapes provide resveratrol, a polyphenol that activates SIRT1, enhancing NAD+-dependent processes and supporting mitochondrial function. Polyphenols (e.g., resveratrol) activate SIRT1, enhancing NAD⁺-dependent processes, and are found in grapes, blueberries, cranberries, peanuts, and dark chocolate.
