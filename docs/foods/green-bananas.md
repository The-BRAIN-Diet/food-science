## Overview

Green (unripe) bananas provide resistant starch, a prebiotic fiber that supports gut microbiome diversity and SCFA production, particularly butyrate.

## Key Substances

### Nutrients
- **Resistant Starch**: Prebiotic fiber
- **Potassium**: Electrolyte
- **B6**: When ripe (less in green)

## From the paper

- "Resistant starch (cooled potatoes, green bananas)"
- "Prebiotic Fibres: Inulin (chicory, onions), GOS (legumes), resistant starch (cooled potatoes, green bananas), pectin (apples)"
- Resistant starch supports butyrate production and gut barrier integrity

## Preparation Notes

- Consume while still green/unripe for resistant starch
- Can be cooked to increase resistant starch
- Supports gut microbiome diversity
- Part of prebiotic fiber strategy
