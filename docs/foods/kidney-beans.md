## Overview

Kidney beans provide plant protein, polyphenols, and prebiotic fiber, supporting gut health and neurotransmitter synthesis. Kidney beans have a DIAAS score of 60-65, indicating they are methionine-limited and should be paired with grains for complete amino acid profile. Kidney beans are polyphenol-rich and support gut health through prebiotic fiber and polyphenol effects on the microbiome.

## Substances

<FoodSubstances details={frontMatter} />

## Preparation Notes

- Soak and cook thoroughly to reduce phytates and improve mineral bioavailability; soaking and sprouting reduces phytates in legumes/grains, improving non-heme iron and zinc bioavailability
- Pair with grains for complete amino acid profile; pair with whole grains or seeds for amino acid complementarity
- Pair with vitamin C to enhance iron absorption, with studies showing up to a fourfold increase when consumed together
- Part of grain-legume complementarity strategy; grain-legume complementarity improves essential amino-acid coverage
