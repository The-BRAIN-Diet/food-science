## Overview

Apples provide pectin (prebiotic fiber), quercetin (polyphenol), and demonstrate important food matrix effects where intact structure blunts glycemic response compared to processed forms. Apple juice induces a substantially greater postprandial insulin spike and lower satiety compared to either apple purée or the intact fruit. Preserving natural food structure (e.g., an apple vs. processed forms) blunts post-prandial glycemic excursions. Quercetin is abundant in apples, with the estimated flavonoid intake ranging from 50 to 800 mg/day, with about 75% of dietary polyphenol count being quercetin.

## Preparation Notes

- Consume whole fruit to preserve food matrix benefits and blunt glycemic response
- Avoid juicing to maintain fiber and glycemic control; apple juice induces substantially greater postprandial insulin spike
- Pair with fat for polyphenol absorption; dietary fat enhances absorption of fat-soluble vitamins
- Pectin supports gut microbiome diversity; prebiotic fibres including pectin (apples) support Bifidobacterium, Akkermansia; ↑ butyrate production; improved gut barrier
- Soluble fibre (from apples, oats, flaxseeds) supports gut health and SCFA production
