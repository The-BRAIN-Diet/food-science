## Overview

Apples provide pectin (prebiotic fiber), quercetin (polyphenol), and demonstrate important food matrix effects where intact structure blunts glycemic response compared to processed forms.

## Key Substances

### Nutrients

- **Pectin**: Prebiotic fiber supporting gut microbiome
- **Fiber**: Soluble and insoluble fiber
- **Vitamin C**: Antioxidant

### Bioactive Substances

- **Quercetin**: Abundant flavonoid (75% of dietary polyphenol count is quercetin)
- **Polyphenols**: Antioxidant compounds

## From the paper

- "Prebiotic Fibres: Inulin (chicory, onions), GOS (legumes), resistant starch (cooled potatoes, green bananas), pectin (apples)"
- "Apple juice induces a substantially greater postprandial insulin spike and lower satiety compared to either apple purée or the intact fruit"
- "Preserving natural food structure (e.g., an apple vs. processed forms) blunts post-prandial glycemic excursions"
- "Quercetin... abundant in capers, apples, onions, berries, kale and soybeans"
- "Soluble fibre (from apples, oats, flaxseeds)"

## Preparation Notes

- Consume whole fruit to preserve food matrix benefits
- Avoid juicing to maintain fiber and glycemic control
- Pair with fat for polyphenol absorption
- Pectin supports gut microbiome diversity
