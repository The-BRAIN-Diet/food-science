## Overview

Clams provide high levels of taurine and vitamin B12, supporting neurotransmission and methylation pathways. Taurine: Regulates calcium signaling, antioxidant defense, and neurotransmission; food sources include scallops, clams, dark-meat poultry, mackerel. Vitamin B12: Liver, clams, fish, eggs, dairy. B12 is essential for methylation, homocysteine recycling, and neurotransmitter synthesis.
