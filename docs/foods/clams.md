## Overview

Clams provide very high levels of taurine (raw clams: ~240–520 mg/100 g) and vitamin B12, supporting neurotransmission, methylation pathways, and cardiovascular health. Among shellfish, clams and mussels are particularly rich in taurine, which regulates calcium signaling, antioxidant defense, and neurotransmission [Wójcik et al. 2009](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2813349/). Vitamin B12 from clams is essential for methylation, homocysteine recycling, and neurotransmitter synthesis. Clams also supply iron, zinc, and selenium.
