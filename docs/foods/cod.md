## Overview

Cod is a lean fish providing omega-3s, taurine, creatine, and complete protein, supporting brain health and neurotransmitter function. Cod has a DIAAS score of 101-104, indicating high protein quality. Taurine regulates calcium signaling, antioxidant defense, and neurotransmission, and cod provides taurine along with creatine for ATP recycling support.
