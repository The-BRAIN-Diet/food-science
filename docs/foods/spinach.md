## Overview

Spinach is a nutrient-dense leafy green providing iron, magnesium, folate, and carotenoids. Important for neurotransmitter synthesis and antioxidant support.

## Key Substances

### Nutrients
- **Iron**: Non-heme iron (enhance absorption with vitamin C)
- **Magnesium**: Cofactor for 300+ enzymatic reactions
- **Folate (B9)**: Methylation and neurotransmitter synthesis
- **Vitamin K**: Blood clotting and bone health
- **Vitamin A**: From beta-carotene

### Bioactive Substances
- **Lutein/Zeaxanthin**: Carotenoids for eye and brain health
- **Oxalates**: Can bind minerals; reduce via boiling

## From the paper

- "Spinach" mentioned as source of iron, magnesium, zinc
- "Boiling spinach, kale, and other greens can reduce oxalate load, improving mineral bioavailability"
- Listed as plant source of CoQ10 (lower amounts than animal sources)
- Source of non-heme iron

## Preparation Notes

- Boiling reduces oxalates and improves mineral bioavailability
- Pair with vitamin C sources to enhance iron absorption
- Pair with fat for carotenoid absorption
