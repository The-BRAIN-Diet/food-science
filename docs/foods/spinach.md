## Overview

Spinach is a nutrient-dense leafy green providing iron, magnesium, zinc, folate, and carotenoids. The BRAIN diet specifically targets leafy green vegetables like spinach that are rich in iron, magnesium, and zinc, though this can introduce high dietary oxalate. Boiling spinach can reduce oxalate load, improving mineral bioavailability. Spinach is important for neurotransmitter synthesis and antioxidant support, providing non-heme iron that can be enhanced with vitamin C pairing.

## Preparation Notes

- Boiling spinach can reduce oxalate load, improving mineral bioavailability [Chai and Liebman 2005](/docs/papers/BRAIN-Diet-References#chai_effect_2005)
- Pair with vitamin C sources (citrus, bell peppers) to enhance iron absorption, with studies showing up to a fourfold increase when consumed together [Hallberg et al. 1989](/docs/papers/BRAIN-Diet-References#hallberg_role_1989)
- Pair with fat (olive oil, avocado) for carotenoid absorption
- Oxalate binds to minerals and forms insoluble compounds, significantly reducing bioavailability; boiling helps mitigate this
- Oxalate negatively affects mitochondrial function and changes redox status in monocytes [Chaiyarit and Thongboonkerd 2020](/docs/papers/BRAIN-Diet-References#chaiyarit_mitochondrial_2020)
