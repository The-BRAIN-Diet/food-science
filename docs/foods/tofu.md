## Overview

Tofu is a soy-based food providing complete plant protein, isoflavones (genistein), and choline, supporting neurotransmitter synthesis and neuroprotection. Tofu is listed as a source for iron, choline, tryptophan, and tyrosine. High-tyrosine protein (eggs, tofu, turkey) for morning meals to support dopamine synthesis. Tofu is often calcium-fortified, making it valuable for plant-based diets.

## Preparation Notes

- Choose calcium-fortified varieties when possible for bone health and calcium support
- Pair with grains for complete amino acid profile; grain-legume complementarity improves essential amino-acid coverage
- Can be prepared various ways (baked, fried, steamed); gentle cooking preserves nutrients
- Part of diverse plant protein strategy
- High-tyrosine protein (eggs, tofu, turkey) for morning meals to support dopamine synthesis
