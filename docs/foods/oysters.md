## Overview

Oysters provide the highest zinc content among common foods, supporting neurotransmitter modulation and antioxidant enzyme function. They are also a unique source of phospholipid-bound omega-3 fatty acids (EPA/DHA), which cross the blood-brain barrier more efficiently than triglyceride forms found in most plant-based sources like algal oil. Oysters and mussels (bivalves) occupy a unique position in dietary philosophy: they are accepted by some vegans who follow ostroveganism, a subset of veganism that accepts bivalves based on their non-sentient status (no central nervous system) and environmental benefits. When farmed, oysters filter pollutants from water and have an incredibly low carbon footprint, making them beneficial for both personal nutrition and planetary health.

## Preparation Notes

- Can be consumed raw (sushi-grade) or cooked; gentle cooking preserves nutrients
- Sustainable when farmed; oysters filter pollutants from water and have a low carbon footprint
- Important for zinc sufficiency; zinc is critical for neurotransmitter modulation, synaptic plasticity, and antioxidant enzyme function
- Unique source of phospholipid-bound omega-3s; DHA/EPA in phospholipid form (particularly phosphatidylcholine) converts to lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) and crosses the blood-brain barrier far more efficiently than triglyceride-bound forms found in algal oil
- Low in mercury compared to many fish species
- Part of diverse protein strategy
- **Ostroveganism note**: Some vegans accept oysters and mussels based on their non-sentient status (no central nervous system) and environmental benefits, making them a unique bridge between vegan and omnivore dietary approaches
