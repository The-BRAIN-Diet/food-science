## Overview

Mackerel is an oily fish providing high levels of EPA/DHA omega-3s, CoQ10, taurine, and vitamin D, supporting brain health and mitochondrial function. Mackerel has a DIAAS score of 103-105, indicating high protein quality. Taurine regulates calcium signaling, antioxidant defense, and neurotransmission, and mackerel is listed as a top source. Regular consumption of oily fish to meet baseline omega-3 requirements (~250–500 mg/day EPA+DHA) is recommended.
