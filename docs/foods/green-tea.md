## Overview

Green tea provides catechins (especially EGCG), L-theanine, and polyphenols that support cognitive function, antioxidant defenses, and metabolic health. Green tea contributes manganese and small amounts of fluoride and potassium, alongside polyphenols that support antioxidant defenses. Green tea catechins (e.g., EGCG, EGC) contribute to visceral adipose tissue reduction and neuroprotective effects in Green Mediterranean Diet studies, which showed attenuated brain atrophy by ~50%. Green tea is also mentioned as a polyphenol antimicrobial for SIBO suppression.

## Preparation Notes

- Steep at lower temperatures to preserve catechins and prevent degradation
- Can reduce non-heme iron absorption if taken with meals; space ≥1 hour from iron-rich meals or add lemon (vitamin C) to mitigate this
- Green tea catechins increase Faecalibacterium and Roseburia; inhibit Enterobacteriaceae; reduce NF-κB activation
- L-theanine found in green tea increases alpha waves and calms without sedation
