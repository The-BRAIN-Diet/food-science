## Overview

Green tea provides catechins (especially EGCG), L-theanine, and polyphenols that support cognitive function, antioxidant defenses, and metabolic health.

## Key Substances

### Nutrients
- **Manganese**: Cofactor for antioxidant enzymes
- **Fluoride**: Trace amounts
- **Potassium**: Electrolyte

### Bioactive Substances
- **EGCG (Epigallocatechin Gallate)**: Primary catechin with neuroprotective effects
- **L-Theanine**: Amino acid that promotes calm focus
- **Catechins**: Polyphenols supporting antioxidant networks

## From the paper

- "Green tea contributes manganese and small amounts of fluoride and potassium, alongside polyphenols that support antioxidant defenses"
- "Green tea catechins (e.g., EGCG, EGC)" mentioned in Green Mediterranean Diet study
- "Polyphenol antimicrobials (berberine, oregano, green tea)" for SIBO suppression
- "Exercise-induced BDNF surges can be potentiated by polyphenols (e.g., blueberries, green tea)"

## Preparation Notes

- Steep at lower temperatures to preserve catechins
- Can reduce non-heme iron absorption if taken with meals
- Space ≥1 hour from iron-rich meals or add lemon (vitamin C)
