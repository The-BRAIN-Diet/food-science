## Overview

Coffee provides caffeine that stimulates dopamine production but has pendulum effects and circadian disruption risks, requiring strategic use.

## Key Substances

### Bioactive Substances
- **Caffeine**: Adenosine receptor antagonism, dopamine stimulation

## From the paper

- "Caffeine is an adenosine receptor antagonism... stop 8 hours before bed considering caffeine has a highly variable half-life, ranging from 2 to 10 h, but possibly up to 20 hours"
- "Caffeine can reverse the deficits associated with fatigue it can be implicated in causing the fatigue in the first place"
- "Caffeine increases striatal dopamine D2/D3 receptor availability"
- "Polyphenol-rich beverages (tea/coffee) can reduce non-heme iron absorption"

## Preparation Notes

- Stop 8+ hours before bed (variable half-life)
- Can stimulate dopamine but may cause fatigue rebound
- Space ≥1 hour from iron-rich meals or add lemon
- Strategic, sparing use may be most effective for ADHD
