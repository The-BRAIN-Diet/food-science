## Overview

Parmesan cheese provides CLA (conjugated linoleic acid), vitamin K2, C15:0 pentadecanoic acid, high protein, and calcium, with studies showing it doesn't raise LDL despite high calcium. Parmesan Cheese: CLA, vitamin K2, glutamate, high protein, calcium; fermented, C15:0. C15:0 (Parmesan and grassfed Butter). Studies have shown that hard cheeses with high calcium do not raise serum LDL levels. Instead of excluding them, dietary strategies should focus on unprocessed, nutrient-dense sources such as Parmesan cheese, grass-fed butter, and pasture-raised egg yolks.
