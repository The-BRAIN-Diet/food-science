## Overview

Whey protein provides high-quality complete protein (DIAAS 118-122) and nicotinamide riboside, an efficient NAD+ precursor supporting mitochondrial function.

## Key Substances

### Nutrients
- **Protein**: DIAAS 118-122, highest quality
- **Leucine**: High content for BDNF and neurotransmitter synthesis
- **Complete amino acids**: All essential amino acids

### Bioactive Substances
- **Nicotinamide Riboside**: Efficient NAD+ precursor with neuroprotective potential

## From the paper

- "Nicotinamide Riboside: Efficient NAD⁺ precursor with neuroprotective potential - Dairy milk, whey protein, yeast-containing foods (e.g., sourdough bread)"
- "Whey protein isolate: DIAAS 118–122, None (limiting amino acids) - High leucine, supports BDNF and neurotransmitter synthesis"

## Preparation Notes

- Can be used as supplement or in smoothies
- High-quality protein source
- Supports mitochondrial NAD+ availability
- Part of protein strategy for brain health
