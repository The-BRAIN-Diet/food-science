## Overview

Whey protein provides high-quality complete protein (DIAAS 118-122) and nicotinamide riboside, an efficient NAD+ precursor supporting mitochondrial function. Whey protein isolate has DIAAS 118–122 with no limiting amino acids, high leucine content, and supports BDNF and neurotransmitter synthesis.
