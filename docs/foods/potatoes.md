## Overview

Potatoes provide complex carbohydrates, potassium, and when cooked and cooled, form resistant starch that supports gut microbiome and SCFA production. Resistant starch (cooled potatoes, green bananas) supports Bifidobacterium, Akkermansia; ↑ butyrate production; improved gut barrier. B6 (chickpeas, potatoes, bananas, whole grains, soy) is a cofactor in the development of all key neurotransmitters. See Cooled Potatoes for resistant starch formation details.

## Preparation Notes

- Cook and cool to form resistant starch; resistant starch forms when certain starchy foods are cooked and then cooled, a process called retrogradation
- Reheating does not reverse resistant starch formation; white rice was cooled and reheated showing a rise in RS content from 0.64 to 1.65 g/100 g and elicited a lower glycemic response
- Supports butyrate production via gut fermentation; resistant starch (cooled potatoes, green bananas) supports Bifidobacterium, Akkermansia; ↑ butyrate production; improved gut barrier
- Lower glycemic response when cooled compared to hot potatoes
