## Overview

Potatoes provide complex carbohydrates, potassium, and when cooked and cooled, form resistant starch that supports gut microbiome and SCFA production.

## Key Substances

### Nutrients

- **Resistant Starch**: Forms when cooked and cooled (retrogradation)
- **Potassium**: Electrolyte
- **B6**: Neurotransmitter cofactor
- **Vitamin C**: When fresh

## From the paper

- "Resistant starch (cooled potatoes, green bananas)"
- "B6(chickpeas, potatoes, bananas, whole grains, soy)"
- See [Cooled Potatoes](./cooled-potatoes.md) for resistant starch formation

## Preparation Notes

- Cook and cool to form resistant starch
- Reheating does not reverse resistant starch
- Supports butyrate production via gut fermentation
- Lower glycemic response when cooled
