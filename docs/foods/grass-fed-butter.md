## Overview

Grass-fed butter provides butyrate, CLA (conjugated linole acid), vitamins A/D/K2, selenium, and C15:0 pentadecanoic acid, supporting brain and metabolic health.

## Key Substances

### Nutrients

- **Vitamins A/D/K2**: Fat-soluble vitamins
- **Selenium**: Antioxidant support

### Bioactive Substances

- **Butyrate**: Short-chain fatty acid
- **CLA (Conjugated Linoleic Acid)**: Rumenic acid and other forms
- **C15:0 (Pentadecanoic Acid)**: Emerging research on health benefits

## From the paper

- "Grass-Fed Butter: Butyrate, Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA; such as rumenic acid), vitamins A/D/K2, selenium, C15:0 pentadecanoic acid"
- "C15:0 (Parmesan and grassfed Butter)"
- "Instead of excluding them, dietary strategies should focus on unprocessed, nutrient-dense sources such as Parmesan cheese, grass-fed butter, and pasture-raised egg yolks"

## Preparation Notes

- Use for finishing vegetables, grains, or cooking (with higher smoke point oil to avoid burning)
- Choose grass-fed/pasture-raised sources
- Part of nutrient-dense fat strategy
- Supports butyrate and K2 intake
