## Overview

Grass-fed butter provides butyrate, CLA (conjugated linoleic acid), vitamins A/D/K2, selenium, and C15:0 pentadecanoic acid, supporting brain and metabolic health. Grass-Fed Butter: Butyrate, Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA; such as rumenic acid), vitamins A/D/K2, selenium, C15:0 pentadecanoic acid. C15:0 (Parmesan and grassfed Butter). Instead of excluding them, dietary strategies should focus on unprocessed, nutrient-dense sources such as Parmesan cheese, grass-fed butter, and pasture-raised egg yolks.
