## Overview

Turmeric is the whole spice (dried and ground root of the Curcuma longa plant) that contains many bioactive compounds, including curcumin (the most well-known polyphenol), demethoxycurcumin, bisdemethoxycurcumin, turmerones (fat-soluble compounds), and essential oils. Only 2–6% of turmeric powder is curcumin. Curcumin is responsible for most of turmeric's anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects. Absorption is enhanced by pairing with black pepper (piperine) and fat. Therapeutic doses typically use 500–1000 mg/day curcumin with piperine.
