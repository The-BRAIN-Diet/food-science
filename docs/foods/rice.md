description: Resistant starch formation when cooled; thiamine source
---

## Overview

Rice provides complex carbohydrates and, when cooked and cooled, forms resistant starch. Also provides thiamine (B1) for mitochondrial glucose metabolism.

## Key Substances

### Nutrients
- **Resistant Starch**: Forms when cooked and cooled (retrogradation)
- **Thiamine (B1)**: Essential for mitochondrial glucose metabolism
- **Complex carbohydrates**: Starch

## From the paper

- "Resistant Starch, forms when certain starchy foods are cooked and then cooled... Foods like rice and potatoes develop higher resistant starch content when chilled"
- "White rice was cooled and reheated showing a rise in RS content from 0.64 to 1.65 g/100 g and elicited a lower glycemic response"
- "Thiamine (B1): Pork, sunflower seeds, salmon, peas, rice, lentils"
- "Pair legumes with grains (e.g., beans + rice) to cover lysine and methionine gaps"

## Preparation Notes

- Cook and cool to form resistant starch
- Reheating does not reverse resistant starch
- Pair with legumes for complete amino acid profile
- Supports butyrate production via gut fermentation
