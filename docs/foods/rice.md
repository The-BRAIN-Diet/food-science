## Overview

Rice provides complex carbohydrates and, when cooked and cooled, forms resistant starch. Also provides thiamine (B1) for mitochondrial glucose metabolism. Resistant Starch forms when certain starchy foods are cooked and then cooled. Foods like rice and potatoes develop higher resistant starch content when chilled. White rice was cooled and reheated showing a rise in RS content from 0.64 to 1.65 g/100 g and elicited a lower glycemic response. Thiamine (B1): Pork, sunflower seeds, salmon, peas, rice, lentils.

## Preparation Notes

- Cook and cool to form resistant starch; resistant starch forms when certain starchy foods are cooked and then cooled
- Reheating does not reverse resistant starch; white rice was cooled and reheated showing a rise in RS content from 0.64 to 1.65 g/100 g and elicited a lower glycemic response
- Pair with legumes for complete amino acid profile; pair legumes with grains (e.g., beans + rice) to cover lysine and methionine gaps
- Supports butyrate production via gut fermentation; resistant starch (cooled potatoes, green bananas, cooled rice) supports Bifidobacterium, Akkermansia; ↑ butyrate production; improved gut barrier

- Thiamine (B1): Pork, sunflower seeds, salmon, peas, rice, lentils; essential for mitochondrial glucose metabolism in the brain leading to ATP production
- Pair legumes with grains (e.g., beans + rice) to cover lysine and methionine gaps; grain-legume complementarity improves essential amino-acid coverage
