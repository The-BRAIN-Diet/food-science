## Overview

Peas provide plant protein, prebiotic fiber, and thiamine (B1), supporting gut health, neurotransmitter synthesis, and mitochondrial function. Thiamine (B1): Pork, sunflower seeds, salmon, peas, rice, lentils. Thiamine is essential for mitochondrial glucose metabolism in the brain leading to ATP production. Peas are part of the legume family with prebiotic benefits.

## Preparation Notes

- Can be consumed fresh, frozen, or dried; fresh peas have higher nutrient content
- Soak dried peas to reduce phytates and improve mineral bioavailability
- Part of diverse legume intake; dietary diversity (≥30 plant foods per week) supports microbial richness and resilience
- Pair with grains for complete amino acid profile; grain-legume complementarity improves essential amino-acid coverage
