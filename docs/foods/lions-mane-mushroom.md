## Overview

Lion's Mane mushroom (Hericium erinaceus) is a medicinal mushroom traditionally used in East Asian medicine. It contains bioactive compounds including hericenones and erinacines, which have been studied for their potential effects on nerve growth factor (NGF) pathways and neuroprotective mechanisms. While preclinical research suggests potential benefits for nerve health and neuroprotective pathways, clinical evidence for cognitive improvements in humans remains limited and requires further investigation. Lion's Mane is also valued for its culinary properties and contains polysaccharides that may support immune function.
