## Overview

Wasabi is a pungent green condiment traditionally made from the grated rhizome of the Wasabia japonica plant, although many commercial products outside Japan use horseradish, mustard, and colourings instead. In the BRAIN Diet context, it is used sparingly as a condiment alongside seafood and rice dishes, adding heat and volatile aromatics without substantially altering macronutrient balance.

## Preparation Notes

- Traditional wasabi is grated fresh and loses pungency quickly; tube or powder versions often blend horseradish, mustard, and colour.
- Use small amounts as a condiment with sushi, fish, and rice-based meals rather than as a primary ingredient.
- Check ingredient lists if you need to differentiate true wasabi from horseradish-based preparations.

- See individual seafood and rice entries for nutritional and mechanistic details; wasabi is treated here primarily as a flavour accent.
