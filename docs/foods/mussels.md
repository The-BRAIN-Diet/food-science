## Overview

Mussels provide a nutrient-dense source of essential nutrients including zinc, vitamin B12, iron, selenium, and vitamin D. Like oysters, mussels are a unique source of phospholipid-bound omega-3 fatty acids (EPA/DHA), which cross the blood-brain barrier more efficiently than triglyceride forms found in most plant-based sources like algal oil. Mussels and oysters (bivalves) occupy a unique position in dietary philosophy: they are accepted by some vegans who follow ostroveganism, a subset of veganism that accepts bivalves based on their non-sentient status (no central nervous system) and environmental benefits. When farmed, mussels filter pollutants from water and have an incredibly low carbon footprint, making them beneficial for both personal nutrition and planetary health.

## Preparation Notes

- Can be consumed cooked; gentle steaming preserves nutrients
- Sustainable when farmed; mussels filter pollutants from water and have a low carbon footprint
- Important for zinc, B12, and iron sufficiency
- Unique source of phospholipid-bound omega-3s; DHA/EPA in phospholipid form (particularly phosphatidylcholine) converts to lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) and crosses the blood-brain barrier far more efficiently than triglyceride-bound forms found in algal oil
- Low in mercury compared to many fish species
- Part of diverse protein strategy
- **Ostroveganism note**: Some vegans accept mussels and oysters based on their non-sentient status (no central nervous system) and environmental benefits, making them a unique bridge between vegan and omnivore dietary approaches
