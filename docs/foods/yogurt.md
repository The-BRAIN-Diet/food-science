## Overview

Yogurt is fermented dairy providing live probiotics, complete protein, and B vitamins, supporting gut-brain axis communication. Fermented dairy is mentioned as nutrient-dense animal food. Practical pairings include spinach + eggs, tomatoes + olive oil, salad + oil, carrots + tahini, kale + avocado, berries + yogurt/nuts. Cultured dairy: Yogurt, kefir, buttermilk (if tolerated) provide live microbes + postbiotic peptides; improved SCFA pools; vagal signaling.

## Preparation Notes

- Choose products with live active cultures for probiotic benefits
- Part of fermented foods strategy; fermented foods provide live microbes + postbiotic peptides; improved SCFA pools; vagal signaling
- Supports gut microbiome diversity; dietary diversity (≥30 plant foods per week) supports microbial richness and resilience
- Pair with berries/nuts for polyphenol synergy; practical pairings: berries + yogurt/nuts

- Fermentation goes further: lactic acid bacteria acidify the medium, activating microbial and endogenous phytases, while also increasing B-vitamin levels [LeBlanc et al. 2011](/docs/papers/BRAIN-Diet-References#leblanc_b-group_2011)
