## Overview

Bananas provide B6, tryptophan, and potassium, supporting neurotransmitter synthesis and electrolyte balance. Bananas are listed as sources for tryptophan and B6, both critical for serotonin synthesis. Serotonin: Mood regulation, emotional control, impulse moderation; food sources include turkey, eggs, dairy, soy, seeds, oats, bananas. Note: Green bananas provide resistant starch (see Green Bananas for different nutrient profile).

## Preparation Notes

- Ripe bananas for B6 and tryptophan content
- Green bananas for resistant starch (prebiotic fiber); resistant starch (cooled potatoes, green bananas) supports gut microbiome
- Part of diverse fruit intake strategy
- Pair with tryptophan-rich proteins for serotonin synthesis; pair tryptophan-rich proteins with moderate carbs to increase Trp:LNAA ratio
- Serotonin: Pair tryptophan-rich proteins with moderate carbs to increase Trp:LNAA ratio; timing midday or evening for calming effect

- Serotonin: Mood regulation, emotional control, impulse moderation; food sources include turkey, eggs, dairy, soy, seeds, oats, bananas; cofactors include tryptophan, B6, magnesium
- B6 (chickpeas, potatoes, bananas, whole grains, soy) is a cofactor in the development of all key neurotransmitters
- Tryptophan: Converted to NAD+ via kynurenine pathway; food sources include turkey, chicken, eggs, pumpkin seeds, oats, soybeans (bananas also contain)
- Note: Green bananas provide resistant starch; resistant starch (cooled potatoes, green bananas) supports Bifidobacterium, Akkermansia; ↑ butyrate production; improved gut barrier
