description: Ellagitannins for urolithin A production and polyphenol support
---

## Overview

Pomegranates provide ellagitannins that gut bacteria convert to urolithin A, supporting mitochondrial resilience, mitophagy, and cognitive function.

## Key Substances

### Nutrients
- **Fiber**: Prebiotic fiber
- **Vitamin C**: Antioxidant
- **Potassium**: Electrolyte

### Bioactive Substances
- **Ellagitannins**: Precursors to urolithin A via gut microbiome
- **Polyphenols**: Antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compounds

## From the paper

- "Polyphenol Sources: Berries, green tea catechins, cocoa flavanols, cranberries, pomegranate"
- "VAT loss tracked with higher total plasma polyphenols and with the microbiome-derived markers urolithin A (via ellagitannins: walnuts/pomegranate)"
- "Higher polyphenol intake and microbial diversity increase urolithin A... supporting mitochondrial resilience and mitophagy"

## Preparation Notes

- Consume whole fruit or juice
- Production of urolithin A depends on gut microbiome diversity
- Pair with diverse plant foods to support microbiome
- Part of polyphenol-rich dietary pattern
