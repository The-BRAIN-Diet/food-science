## Overview

Pomegranates provide ellagitannins that gut bacteria convert to urolithin A, supporting mitochondrial resilience, mitophagy, and cognitive function. The Green Mediterranean Diet study showed greater visceral adipose tissue loss that tracked with higher total plasma polyphenols and with the microbiome-derived markers urolithin A (via ellagitannins: walnuts/pomegranate). Higher polyphenol intake and microbial diversity increase urolithin A and related metabolites, supporting mitochondrial resilience and mitophagy and improving cognitive endurance.

## Substances

<FoodSubstances details={frontMatter} />

## Preparation Notes

- Consume whole fruit or juice to obtain ellagitannins
- Production of urolithin A depends on gut microbiome diversity; higher polyphenol intake and microbial diversity increase urolithin A production
- Pair with diverse plant foods to support microbiome; dietary diversity (≥30 plant foods per week) supports microbial richness and resilience
- Part of polyphenol-rich dietary pattern; polyphenol sources including berries, green tea catechins, cocoa flavanols, cranberries, pomegranate support gut microbiome health
