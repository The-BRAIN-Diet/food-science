## Overview

Fermented vegetables provide live probiotics, postbiotic compounds, and enhanced nutrient bioavailability, supporting gut-brain axis communication. Fermented Foods: Sauerkraut, kimchi, kefir, miso, kombucha provide live microbes + postbiotic peptides; improved SCFA pools; vagal signaling. Fermentation goes further: lactic acid bacteria acidify the medium, activating microbial and endogenous phytases, while also increasing B-vitamin levels.

## Preparation Notes

- Include in diverse fermented foods rotation; fermented foods provide live microbes + postbiotic peptides; improved SCFA pools; vagal signaling
- Supports gut microbiome diversity; dietary diversity (≥30 plant foods per week) supports microbial richness and resilience
- Enhanced nutrient bioavailability; fermentation goes further: lactic acid bacteria acidify the medium, activating microbial and endogenous phytases, while also increasing B-vitamin levels
- Some varieties may produce GABA through specific bacterial strains; Levilactobacillus brevis strains isolated from fermented foods can produce GABA
