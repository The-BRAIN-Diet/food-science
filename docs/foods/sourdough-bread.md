## Overview

Sourdough bread, especially when made with quinoa or other functional flours, provides GABA, improved amino acid bioavailability, and optimized Maillard reaction products (MRPs) with reduced acrylamide. Quinoa sourdough offers both very high nutrients (due to the quinoa) and a high GABA profile, and sourdough fermentation enhances bioavailability of amino acids through activation of endogenous cereal proteases.

## Substances

<FoodSubstances details={frontMatter} />

## Preparation Notes

- Use whole grain or pseudograin flours for higher nutrient content
- Long fermentation (12-18h) improves amino acid release
- Dutch oven baking reduces acrylamide formation
- Glycine addition (0.3-0.4%) further reduces acrylamide
- Traditionally fermented breads optimize Maillard Reaction Products (MRPs)
