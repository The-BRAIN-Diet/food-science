## Overview

Sourdough bread, especially when made with quinoa or other functional flours, provides GABA, improved amino acid bioavailability, and optimized Maillard reaction products (MRPs) with reduced acrylamide.

## Key Substances

### Nutrients
- **GABA**: Produced by Levilactobacillus brevis in quinoa sourdough
- **Amino acids**: Enhanced bioavailability through proteolysis
- **B Vitamins**: Produced during fermentation
- **Minerals**: Magnesium, potassium, iron, zinc, copper, manganese (varies by flour)

### Bioactive Substances
- **Maillard Reaction Products (MRPs)**: Antioxidant melanoidins when optimized
- **Probiotics**: Live lactic acid bacteria
- **Postbiotics**: Beneficial fermentation compounds

## From the paper

- "Quinoa sourdough... offers both very high nutrients (due to the quinoa) and a high GABA profile"
- "Sourdough fermentation enhances bioavailability of amino acids through activation of endogenous cereal proteases"
- "Traditionally fermented breads that optimize Maillard Reaction Products (MRPs)"
- "Nicotinamide Riboside: Dairy milk, whey protein, yeast-containing foods (e.g., sourdough bread)"
- Detailed bread-making table showing how sourdough reduces acrylamide and enhances MRPs

## Preparation Notes

- Use whole grain or pseudograin flours for higher nutrient content
- Long fermentation (12-18h) improves amino acid release
- Dutch oven baking reduces acrylamide formation
- Glycine addition (0.3-0.4%) further reduces acrylamide
