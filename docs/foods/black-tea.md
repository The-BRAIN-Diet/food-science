## Overview

Black tea provides polyphenols and may contain some compounds supporting NAD+ pathways, though less studied than green tea. Polyphenol-rich beverages (tea/coffee) can reduce non-heme iron absorption if taken with iron-rich plant meals; spacing them ≥1 hour away or adding vitamin-C sources (e.g., lemon) favors iron uptake.
