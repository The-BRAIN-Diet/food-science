## Overview

Pickles (unpasteurized fermented) provide live probiotics, including Levilactobacillus brevis strains that produce GABA through the glutamate decarboxylase pathway.

## Key Substances

### Nutrients

- **Sodium**: High in pickled form
- **Fiber**: From vegetables

### Bioactive Substances

- **Probiotics**: Levilactobacillus brevis (GABA-producing)
- **GABA**: Produced by fermentation bacteria

## From the paper

- "Levilactobacillus brevis is one of the key bacteria known to produce GABA... This bacteria is active in L. brevis strains isolated from fermented foods, such as kimchi, kefir, and pickles"

## Preparation Notes

- Choose unpasteurized for live probiotics
- Rinse if high-sodium variety
- Part of fermented foods strategy
- Supports GABA production via gut microbiome
