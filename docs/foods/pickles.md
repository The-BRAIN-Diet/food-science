## Overview

Pickles (unpasteurized fermented) provide live probiotics, including Levilactobacillus brevis strains that produce GABA through the glutamate decarboxylase pathway. Levilactobacillus brevis is one of the key bacteria known to produce GABA, and this bacteria is active in L. brevis strains isolated from fermented foods, such as kimchi, kefir, and pickles.
