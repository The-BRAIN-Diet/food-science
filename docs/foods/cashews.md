## Substances

<FoodSubstances details={frontMatter} />

## Preparation Notes

- Soak to reduce phytates and improve zinc bioavailability; soaking and sprouting reduces phytates in legumes/grains, improving non-heme iron and zinc bioavailability
- Part of diverse nut/seed intake; dietary diversity (≥30 plant foods per week) supports microbial richness and resilience
- Pair with animal proteins or vitamin C for better zinc absorption
- Supports zinc sufficiency; zinc is critical for neurotransmitter modulation, synaptic plasticity, and antioxidant enzyme function
