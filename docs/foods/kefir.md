## Overview

Kefir is fermented milk providing diverse probiotics, including potential GABA-producing strains, and postbiotic compounds. Fermented Foods: Sauerkraut, kimchi, kefir, miso, kombucha provide live microbes + postbiotic peptides; improved SCFA pools; vagal signaling. Kefir: Fermented milk drink, diverse probiotic strains. Levilactobacillus brevis is active in L. brevis strains isolated from fermented foods, such as kimchi, kefir, and pickles, and can produce GABA.

## Preparation Notes

- Choose products with live active cultures for probiotic benefits
- Part of fermented foods rotation; fermented foods provide live microbes + postbiotic peptides; improved SCFA pools; vagal signaling
- Supports gut microbiome diversity; dietary diversity (≥30 plant foods per week) supports microbial richness and resilience
- Potential GABA production via specific strains; Levilactobacillus brevis strains isolated from fermented foods, such as kimchi, kefir, and pickles can produce GABA
