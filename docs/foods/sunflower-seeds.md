## Overview

Sunflower seeds provide thiamine (B1), vitamin E, and are the source of sunflower lecithin, supporting mitochondrial function and choline intake. Thiamine (B1): Pork, sunflower seeds, salmon, peas, rice, lentils. Thiamine is essential for mitochondrial glucose metabolism in the brain leading to ATP production. Vegans should ensure adequate choline intake (e.g., soy or sunflower lecithin, soy foods, quinoa, broccoli).

## Preparation Notes

- Can be consumed raw or roasted; gentle roasting preserves nutrients
- Part of diverse seed intake; dietary diversity (≥30 plant foods per week) supports microbial richness and resilience
- Supports mitochondrial function via thiamine; thiamine does not exist in a large brain "reservoir"; the CNS maintains small, tightly regulated intracellular pools that depend on continuous, transporter-mediated supply
- Source of sunflower lecithin for choline support; vegans should ensure adequate choline intake (e.g., soy or sunflower lecithin, soy foods, quinoa, broccoli)
