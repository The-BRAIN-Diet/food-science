## Overview

Brussels sprouts provide sulfur-containing compounds that serve as glutathione precursors, supporting antioxidant defenses and mitochondrial health. Sulphur-containing vegetables that provide glutathione precursors (e.g., broccoli, Brussels sprouts, garlic, onions). Niacin-rich foods (e.g., salmon, chicken breast, turkey, peanuts, and mushrooms), sulphur-containing vegetables that provide glutathione precursors (e.g., broccoli, Brussels sprouts, garlic, onions) support NAD+ availability, glutathione synthesis, and mitochondrial health.

## Preparation Notes

- Light cooking or raw consumption may preserve compounds; gentle cooking preserves nutrients
- Part of diverse cruciferous vegetable intake; dietary diversity (≥30 plant foods per week) supports microbial richness and resilience
- Supports glutathione synthesis; glutathione (GSH) is one of the body's major antioxidants
- Pair with other sulfur-containing vegetables for synergistic effects
