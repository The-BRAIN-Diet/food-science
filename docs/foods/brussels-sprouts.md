## Overview

Brussels sprouts provide sulfur-containing compounds that serve as glutathione precursors, supporting antioxidant defenses and mitochondrial health.

## Key Substances

### Nutrients

- **Folate (B9)**: Methylation support
- **Vitamin C**: Antioxidant
- **Fiber**: Prebiotic fiber

### Bioactive Substances

- **Sulfur compounds**: Glutathione precursors
- **Isothiocyanates**: Potential sulforaphane-like compounds

## From the paper

- "Sulphur-containing vegetables that provide glutathione precursors (e.g., broccoli, Brussels sprouts, garlic, onions)"
- "Niacin-rich foods (e.g., salmon, chicken breast, turkey, peanuts, and mushrooms), sulphur-containing vegetables that provide glutathione precursors (e.g., broccoli, Brussels sprouts, garlic, onions)"

## Preparation Notes

- Light cooking or raw consumption may preserve compounds
- Part of diverse cruciferous vegetable intake
- Supports glutathione synthesis
- Pair with other sulfur-containing vegetables
