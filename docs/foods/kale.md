## Overview

Kale is a nutrient-dense leafy green providing iron, magnesium, zinc, quercetin, and carotenoids. The BRAIN diet specifically targets leafy green vegetables i.e. kale and spinach that are rich in iron, magnesium, and zinc, though this can introduce high dietary oxalate. Boiling kale can reduce oxalate load, improving mineral bioavailability. Kale is abundant in quercetin, a flavonoid polyphenol with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.

## Preparation Notes

- Boiling reduces oxalates and improves mineral bioavailability [Chai and Liebman 2005](/docs/papers/BRAIN-Diet-References#chai_effect_2005)
- Pair with fat (avocado, olive oil) for carotenoid absorption; co-consuming a small amount of unsaturated fat improves micelle formation and chylomicron packaging
- Pair with vitamin C sources to enhance iron absorption, with studies showing up to a fourfold increase when consumed together [Hallberg et al. 1989](/docs/papers/BRAIN-Diet-References#hallberg_iron_1989)
- Part of diverse leafy green strategy
- Practical pairings: carrots + tahini, kale + avocado, berries + yogurt/nuts

- Oxalate binds to minerals and forms insoluble compounds, significantly reducing bioavailability; boiling helps mitigate this
- Vitamin C significantly improves non-heme iron absorption by reducing ferric to ferrous iron, with studies showing up to a fourfold increase when consumed together [Hallberg et al. 1989](/docs/papers/BRAIN-Diet-References#hallberg_iron_1989)
