## Overview

Onions provide inulin (prebiotic fiber), quercetin (polyphenol), and sulfur compounds that support gut microbiome, antioxidant defenses, and glutathione synthesis. Prebiotic Fibres: Inulin (chicory, onions), GOS (legumes), resistant starch (cooled potatoes, green bananas), pectin (apples). Inulin (chicory, onions) supports Bifidobacterium, Akkermansia; ↑ butyrate production; improved gut barrier. Quercetin is abundant in capers, apples, onions, berries, kale and soybeans.

## Preparation Notes

- Can be consumed raw or cooked; cooking may enhance some compounds
- Part of diverse prebiotic fiber strategy; prebiotic fibres including inulin (chicory, onions) support Bifidobacterium, Akkermansia; ↑ butyrate production; improved gut barrier
- Pair with other allium vegetables for synergistic effects
- Sulphur-containing vegetables that provide glutathione precursors (e.g., broccoli, Brussels sprouts, garlic, onions) support antioxidant defenses
