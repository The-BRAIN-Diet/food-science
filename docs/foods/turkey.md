## Overview

Turkey provides high-quality protein rich in tryptophan (serotonin precursor) and niacin (B3), supporting mood regulation and mitochondrial energy production. Turkey is listed as a source for tryptophan, which is converted to NAD+ via kynurenine pathway and serves as a serotonin precursor. Turkey is also listed as a niacin-rich food, supporting NAD+ synthesis for mitochondrial function. High-tyrosine protein from turkey supports dopamine synthesis for morning meals.

## Substances

## Preparation Notes

- Pair with complex carbohydrates to enhance tryptophan-to-serotonin conversion; pair tryptophan-rich proteins with moderate carbs to increase Trp:LNAA ratio
- Best consumed midday or evening for calming effect; timing midday or evening for calming effect
- Gentle cooking preserves tryptophan and prevents formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs)
- High-tyrosine protein (eggs, tofu, turkey) for morning meals to support dopamine synthesis

- Tryptophan: Converted to NAD+ via kynurenine pathway; food sources include turkey, chicken, eggs, pumpkin seeds, oats, soybeans
- Serotonin: Mood regulation, emotional control, impulse moderation; food sources include turkey, eggs, dairy, soy, seeds, oats, bananas; cofactors include tryptophan, B6, magnesium
- Niacin (Vitamin B₃): Directly converted to NAD+ via salvage pathway; food sources include chicken, turkey, tuna, salmon, mushrooms, peanuts, whole grains [Pirinen et al. 2020](/docs/papers/BRAIN-Diet-References#pirinen_niacin_2020)
- Niacin-rich foods (e.g., salmon, chicken breast, turkey, peanuts, and mushrooms) support NAD+ availability, glutathione synthesis, and mitochondrial health
- High-tyrosine protein (eggs, tofu, turkey) for morning meals to support dopamine synthesis
