description: Lycopene, vitamin C, and food matrix effects on absorption
---

## Overview

Tomatoes provide lycopene (carotenoid), vitamin C, and demonstrate food matrix effects where cooking and fat pairing enhance carotenoid absorption.

## Key Substances

### Nutrients
- **Lycopene**: Carotenoid antioxidant
- **Vitamin C**: Enhances non-heme iron absorption
- **Potassium**: Electrolyte

### Bioactive Substances
- **Carotenoids**: Lycopene for antioxidant support

## From the paper

- "The bioaccessibility of carotenoids in vegetables is remarkably low... lycopene in canned and fresh tomatoes is <1%"
- "Prolonged cooking increases access to lycopene in tomatoes where cell walls need to be broken down"
- "Practical pairings: spinach + eggs, tomatoes + olive oil, salad + oil"
- "Eat your beans with vitamin C-rich foods (e.g., tomatoes, peppers, citrus)"

## Preparation Notes

- Cooking breaks down cell walls and increases lycopene bioavailability
- Pair with fat (olive oil) for enhanced absorption
- Canned tomatoes may have higher lycopene due to processing
- Pair with iron-rich plant foods for enhanced absorption
