## Overview

Tomatoes provide lycopene (carotenoid), vitamin C, and demonstrate food matrix effects where cooking and fat pairing enhance carotenoid absorption. The bioaccessibility of carotenoids in vegetables is remarkably low—lycopene in canned and fresh tomatoes is less than 1%. Prolonged cooking increases access to lycopene in tomatoes where cell walls need to be broken down. Practical pairings include spinach + eggs, tomatoes + olive oil, salad + oil.

## Preparation Notes

- Cooking breaks down cell walls and increases lycopene bioavailability; prolonged cooking increases access to lycopene in tomatoes where cell walls need to be broken down
- Pair with fat (olive oil) for enhanced absorption; co-consuming a small amount of unsaturated fat improves micelle formation and chylomicron packaging, increasing carotenoid and fat-soluble vitamin absorption
- Canned tomatoes may have higher lycopene due to processing
- Pair with iron-rich plant foods for enhanced absorption; eat your beans with vitamin C-rich foods (e.g., tomatoes, peppers, citrus) to enhance iron absorption
- Practical pairings: spinach + eggs, tomatoes + olive oil, salad + oil
