## Overview

Broccoli is a cruciferous vegetable providing sulforaphane (from glucoraphanin), folate, and sulfur compounds that support glutathione synthesis and mitochondrial health. Isothiocyanates (ITCs) like sulforaphane, created through enzymatic activity from glucoraphanin in broccoli, have shown promising results in reducing oxidative stress. Broccoli is listed as a sulphur-containing vegetable that provides glutathione precursors, supporting antioxidant defenses and brain health.

## Preparation Notes

- Light cooking or raw consumption preserves sulforaphane formation
- Chewing activates myrosinase enzyme to convert glucoraphanin to sulforaphane
- Pair with fat for fat-soluble vitamin absorption
- Sulforaphane activates Nrf2 and has higher bioavailability than other polyphenol supplements
