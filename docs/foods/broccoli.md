## Overview

Broccoli is a cruciferous vegetable providing sulforaphane (from glucoraphanin), folate, and sulfur compounds that support glutathione synthesis and mitochondrial health.

## Key Substances

### Nutrients
- **Folate (B9)**: Methylation and neurotransmitter synthesis
- **Vitamin C**: Antioxidant
- **Vitamin K**: Blood clotting and bone health
- **Fiber**: Prebiotic fiber

### Bioactive Substances
- **Sulforaphane**: Isothiocyanate (ITC) from glucoraphanin; activates Nrf2, higher bioavailability than other polyphenol supplements
- **Glutathione precursors**: Sulfur-containing compounds

## From the paper

- "Isothiocyanates (ITCs) like sulforaphane, created through enzymatic activity from glucoraphanin in broccoli, have also shown promising results in reducing oxidative stress"
- "Sulphur-containing vegetables that provide glutathione precursors (e.g., broccoli, Brussels sprouts, garlic, onions)"
- Listed as plant source of CoQ10 (lower amounts)
- "Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN): Edamame, broccoli, cucumber, avocado"
- "Soy or sunflower lecithin, soy foods, quinoa, broccoli" for choline support

## Preparation Notes

- Light cooking or raw consumption preserves sulforaphane formation
- Chewing activates myrosinase enzyme to convert glucoraphanin to sulforaphane
- Pair with fat for fat-soluble vitamin absorption
