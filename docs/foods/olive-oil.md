## Overview

Regular olive oil (refined or blended) has significantly lower bioactive polyphenol content compared to extra virgin olive oil (EVOO). **Olive oil's brain benefits come from polyphenols, not fatty acids.** Regular olive oil undergoes processing that reduces or eliminates the secoiridoids and phenolics (oleuropein, oleocanthal, oleacein, hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol) that provide the neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects. For brain health benefits, extra virgin olive oil, particularly early harvest EVOO, is strongly recommended due to its much higher concentration of bioactive polyphenols.

## Preparation Notes

- See [Extra Virgin Olive Oil](./extra-virgin-olive-oil.md) for detailed information on bioactive polyphenols
- Regular olive oil has significantly lower polyphenol content than EVOO
- For brain health benefits, use extra virgin olive oil, preferably early harvest
- EVOO provides secoiridoids and phenolics (oleuropein, oleocanthal, oleacein, hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol) that are largely absent in regular olive oil

## References

- Regular olive oil has significantly lower bioactive polyphenol content compared to extra virgin olive oil
- **Olive oil's brain benefits come from polyphenols, not fatty acids** - these are found in meaningful amounts primarily in extra virgin olive oil, especially early harvest EVOO
- For brain health, use extra virgin olive oil which contains secoiridoids and phenolics (oleuropein aglycone, oleocanthal, oleacein, tyrosol, hydroxytyrosol) that provide mitophagy, SIRT1, AMPK, NF-κB inhibition, NRF2 activation, and neuroprotective effects
