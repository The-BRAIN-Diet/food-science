## Overview

Pork provides thiamine (B1), creatine, zinc, and complete protein, supporting mitochondrial glucose metabolism and neurotransmitter function. Thiamine (B1): Pork, sunflower seeds, salmon, peas, rice, lentils. Thiamine is essential for mitochondrial glucose metabolism in the brain leading to ATP production. Creatine: Supports ATP recycling in neurons; enhances working memory and cognitive processing speed; food sources include beef, lamb, pork, salmon, tuna, cod, scallops.

## Substances

## Preparation Notes

- Choose quality sources when possible
- Gentle cooking preserves thiamine; thiamine does not exist in a large brain "reservoir"; the CNS maintains small, tightly regulated intracellular pools that depend on continuous, transporter-mediated supply
- Important for thiamine and creatine intake
- Part of diverse protein strategy
- Supports neurotransmitter synthesis through tryptophan and tyrosine content
