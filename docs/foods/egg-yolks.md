## Overview

Egg yolks provide choline (acetylcholine precursor), lutein/zeaxanthin (carotenoids), and fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K2), supporting neurotransmitter synthesis and brain health.

## Key Substances

### Nutrients
- **Choline**: High content for acetylcholine synthesis
- **Lutein/Zeaxanthin**: Carotenoids for eye and brain health
- **Fat-soluble vitamins**: A, D, E, K2
- **Protein**: Complete amino acid profile

## From the paper

- "Acetylcholine and choline: Egg yolks, fish roe, soy, wheat germ, liver"
- "Carotenoids are abundant in leafy greens, orange and yellow vegetables, corn, and egg yolks"
- "Pasture-raised egg yolks" for nutrient density

## Preparation Notes

- Choose pasture-raised for higher nutrient content
- Gentle cooking preserves nutrients
- Important for choline and carotenoid intake
- Pair with carotenoid-rich vegetables for enhanced absorption
