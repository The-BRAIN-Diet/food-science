## Overview

Pumpkin seeds are nutrient-dense seeds providing zinc, tryptophan, magnesium, and other minerals critical for neurotransmitter synthesis and antioxidant function. Pumpkin seeds have high zinc content for neurotransmitter modulation and are listed as sources for tryptophan, zinc, and glutamate synthesis. Plant zinc is less bioavailable due to phytates; soaking/sprouting helps improve bioavailability.

## Preparation Notes

- Soak to reduce phytates and improve mineral bioavailability; soaking and sprouting reduces phytates in legumes/grains, improving non-heme iron and zinc bioavailability
- Pair with grains for complete amino acid profile; grain-legume complementarity improves essential amino-acid coverage
- Pair with complex carbs for tryptophan-to-serotonin conversion; tryptophan + complex carbohydrates aid serotonin conversion to melatonin; examples include pumpkin seeds + oats
- Plant zinc less bioavailable due to phytates; soaking/sprouting helps improve bioavailability
