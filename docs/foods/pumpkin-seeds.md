description: High zinc, tryptophan, and magnesium for neurotransmitter support
---

## Overview

Pumpkin seeds are nutrient-dense seeds providing zinc, tryptophan, magnesium, and other minerals critical for neurotransmitter synthesis and antioxidant function.

## Key Substances

### Nutrients
- **Zinc**: High content for neurotransmitter modulation (DIAAS 40-45)
- **Tryptophan**: Serotonin precursor
- **Magnesium**: Cofactor for neurotransmitter pathways
- **Iron**: Non-heme iron
- **Protein**: Plant protein (lysine-limited)

### Bioactive Substances
- **Polyphenols**: Antioxidant compounds

## From the paper

- "Pumpkin seeds: High zinc content for neurotransmitter modulation"
- "Tryptophan: Turkey, chicken, eggs, pumpkin seeds, oats, soybeans"
- "Tryptophan + complex carbs (pumpkin seeds + oats)" for sleep support
- "Zinc: Oysters, beef, crab, chicken, pork, Pumpkin seeds, lentils, chickpeas, cashews"
- "Glutamate: Lentils, poultry, fish, spinach, pumpkin seeds"

## Preparation Notes

- Soak to reduce phytates and improve mineral bioavailability
- Pair with grains for complete amino acid profile
- Pair with complex carbs for tryptophan-to-serotonin conversion
