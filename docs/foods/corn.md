## Overview

Corn provides carotenoids (lutein, zeaxanthin) and complex carbohydrates, supporting eye/brain health and stable glucose release. Carotenoids are abundant in leafy greens, orange and yellow vegetables, corn, and egg yolks. Carotenoids, particularly lutein, zeaxanthin, and β-carotene, play a neuroprotective role through their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.

## Preparation Notes

- Pair with fat for carotenoid absorption; co-consuming a small amount of unsaturated fat improves micelle formation and chylomicron packaging, increasing carotenoid and fat-soluble vitamin absorption
- Can be consumed fresh, cooked, or as whole grain; cooking may enhance some nutrient bioavailability
- Part of diverse vegetable intake; dietary diversity (≥30 plant foods per week) supports microbial richness and resilience
- Supports carotenoid diversity; lutein and zeaxanthin have been associated with improved cognitive performance, especially in domains such as memory, processing speed, and visual-spatial function
