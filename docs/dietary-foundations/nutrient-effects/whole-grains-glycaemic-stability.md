# Whole Grains and Glycaemic Stability

Whole grains provide fibre, B vitamins, and minerals while supporting more gradual glucose release compared to refined grains. Within the BRAIN Diet, stable glycaemic response is linked to sustained cognitive function, mood regulation, and metabolic health.

## Overview

Whole grains (oats, barley, quinoa, brown rice, whole-wheat pasta, and others) contain:

- **Fibre**: Slows digestion and blunts post-prandial glucose spikes; supports gut microbiome and SCFA production
- **B vitamins**: Support energy metabolism and neurotransmitter synthesis
- **Minerals**: Magnesium, zinc, and others involved in enzymatic and neuronal function

Beta-glucans in oats and barley are particularly well studied for their effects on glycaemic response and cholesterol metabolism.

## Practical Considerations

- Mixing white and whole-grain pasta during transition periods can support gradual fibre exposure (see [Fibre, Gut Adaptation](/docs/dietary-foundations/digestion-microbiome/fibre-gut-adaptation))
- Pairing grains with protein, healthy fats, or vinegar can further moderate glucose response
- Whole grains support gut microbiome diversity and SCFA production
