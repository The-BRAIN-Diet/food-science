# Dietary Foundations

The BRAIN Diet is a systems-based nutrition framework designed to support brain health by addressing related key biological processes such as neurotransmitter balance, mitochondrial function, inflammation, and the gut–brain axis. Developed in the context of research on ADHD, neurodevelopmental differences, neurodegenerative risk, and broader cognitive health, it focuses on supporting core regulatory functions relevant to everyone. It is diet for overall health just with deep brain research focus.

In terms of dietary patterns, the foods used across this site are globally inspired, but the overall structure of the diet most closely resembles a Mediterranean-style pattern. 

## Navigating the Foundations Pages

The pages below introduce core concepts related to digestion, metabolism, and dietary adaptation. 

More pages of relevance will come on line continually. 
### Digestion & Microbiome

- [Fibre, Gut Adaptation &amp; Digestive Resilience](/docs/dietary-foundations/digestion-microbiome/fibre-gut-adaptation)
- [Gut–Brain Axis](/docs/dietary-foundations/digestion-microbiome/gut-brain-axis)
- [Gut Microbiome](/docs/biological-targets/gut-microbiome)
- [SCFAs](/docs/substances/microbial-metabolites/scfas/scfas)
- [Foods supporting SCFA production](/docs/biological-targets/gut-microbiome#foods-supporting-scfa-production)

### Nutrient Effects

- [Whole Grains &amp; Glycaemic Stability](/docs/dietary-foundations/nutrient-effects/whole-grains-glycaemic-stability)
- Dietary Fat &amp; Metabolic Signalling *(coming soon)*

## Purpose of the Dietary Foundations Section

This section provides background information that helps explain why particular ingredients, food combinations, and preparation methods appear in the recipes and therapeutic food lists on this site.

It covers topics such as:

- how digestion and the microbiome influence nutrient availability
- how dietary patterns affect metabolic stability and energy regulation
- how meals may influence inflammatory signalling and neurological processes
- how tolerance to certain foods can change over time

These pages are designed to support understanding rather than prescribe strict rules. Readers may use them as reference material alongside recipes or therapeutic food pages.

## Relationship to Therapeutic Areas

The site includes therapeutic-area pages that group foods according to observational evidence and emerging research suggesting potential relevance to particular health contexts. These groupings are not intended as medical treatment protocols, but as structured ways of organising dietary information.

Future observational work and clinical studies may explore these associations in greater depth. The Dietary Foundations pages provide the physiological context that helps explain why specific foods appear in those therapeutic categories.

## Scope and Use of This Information

The material in this section is provided for educational purposes. It summarises current nutritional science and systems-based research in an accessible form and aims to help readers make informed dietary choices.

It is not intended to replace personalised medical advice.
Individuals with diagnosed conditions, digestive disorders, or specific health concerns should seek guidance from an appropriately qualified healthcare professional.
