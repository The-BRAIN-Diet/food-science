# Inflammation and Oxidative Stress

Chronic inflammation and oxidative stress are interconnected biological dysfunctions that contribute to cognitive, emotional, and behavioral dysregulation in ADHD and other neurodevelopmental conditions. The BRAIN Diet targets these pathways through antioxidant networks, anti-inflammatory nutrients, and strategies to reduce oxidative load.

## Overview

Neurodevelopmental disorders such as ADHD, ASD, and bipolar disorder, and neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, have complex, multifactorial origins. Although the precise causes are not fully understood, these conditions share overlapping biological dysfunctions, including mitochondrial impairment, **chronic inflammation, oxidative stress**, impaired methylation, gut–brain axis disruption, glucose dysregulation, micronutrient deficiencies, and neurotransmitter imbalances. These interconnected systems, while not sole causes of such disorders, can contribute to symptom burden and overall metabolic and mental health (paper.txt, line 132).

## Oxidative Stress in ADHD

### Definition and Mechanisms

Oxidative stress arises when reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) exceed antioxidant capacity, damaging lipids, proteins, DNA, and impairing mitochondrial efficiency. In ADHD, adult cohorts frequently show elevated lipid peroxidation and oxidative indices, while antioxidant status appears normal or variably shifted, consistent with greater oxidative load rather than a primary antioxidant deficit. Multiple real-world factors contribute i.e. sleep and circadian disruption, glycaemic variability/insulin resistance, high-ω-6/oxidised oils, alcohol, smoke/pollution, and dietary source contaminants (metals, Ultra Processed Foods UPFs) (paper.txt, line 619).

The BRAIN Diet targets this network by combining polyphenol-dense foods, omega-3s, sulfur amino acids (cysteine/glycine), and key cofactors (Se/Zn/Cu) with exposure control and gentler cooking to lower dietary AGE/ALE load. We treat oxidative stress as a state-sensitive, potentially modifiable contributor to symptom severity and predefine biomarkers to test whether lowering redox load improves outcomes. In neurodevelopmental conditions such as ADHD, there is increasing recognition that oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuroinflammation contribute to cognitive, emotional, and behavioral dysregulation (paper.txt, line 620).

### Biomarkers and Evidence

Regarding oxidative stress, many studies have isolated potential biomarkers for ADHD, though some studies have sometimes shown marginal results there is a clear positive pattern showing oxidative stress as a correlation with ADHD. (Bulut et al. 2007) was a foundational study finding significantly higher Malondialdehyde levels in adult ADHD, a lipid-peroxidation marker, compared with healthy controls, indicating increased oxidative stress. More recently, (Kurhan and Alp 2021) reported a shift in thiol/disulfide homeostasis toward oxidation and higher urinary 8-OHdG (DNA oxidation) in adults with ADHD versus controls, consistent with increased oxidative damage. In an independent cohort, (Miniksar et al. 2023) found elevated oxidative stress index (OSI) / total oxidative status (TOS), supporting impaired redox balance in adult ADHD, suggesting malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels may be effective biomarkers in diagnosing ADHD while they noted the need to better understand the negative role of oxidative stress in ADHD (paper.txt, line 621).

### Testable Hypothesis

Rather than treating MDA/SOD as just diagnostic markers of oxidative stress, they could be framed as a potentially modifiable amplifier of symptom severity of ADHD. Future clinical trials of the BRAIN Diet should explicitly test whether lowering redox load improves clinical outcomes. Comparing Total Antioxidant Capacity (TAC) with oxidative damage markers (e.g., MDA/4-HNE, 8-OHdG) before and after the trial against ADHD related cognitive biomarkers could be a real potential future biomarker for ADHD (paper.txt, line 686).

## Neuroinflammation

### Mechanisms

When the amount of anti-oxidants generated is inadequate to offset the detrimental effects of hazardous reactive oxygen species ROS, oxidative stress arises. Increased oxidative stress has been linked to cellular damage, DNA repair system malfunction, and in turn mitochondrial dysfunction (MD) (Solleiro-Villavicencio and Rivas-Arancibia 2018a).

High levels of ROS can cause astrocytes and microglia to become activated; reactive astrocytes can release pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., ADHD associated biomarkers IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α (Chang et al. 2020a)), exacerbating inflammation and neuronal damage creating a vicious cycle (Solleiro-Villavicencio and Rivas-Arancibia 2018b). This vicious circle may increase the risk of ADHD pathogenesis (paper.txt, lines 735-736).

### Gut-Brain Axis and Inflammation

The gut barrier is the dynamic interface between the microbiome, immune system, and brain. Its integrity is critical: when the barrier weakens, bacterial fragments such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS, a bacterial endotoxin) and dietary antigens enter circulation, sustaining chronic low-grade inflammation and altering neurotransmitter metabolism. These processes are strongly correlated with poor cognitive function, fatigue, mood instability, and ADHD symptom severity (paper.txt, line 505).

Diets rich in probiotics, prebiotics, and fibre (which help produce short-chain fatty acids like butyrate, Propionate and lactate) can enhance gut health. Furthermore, a decreased microbial diversity (alpha diversity) has also been reported in ADHD (Prehn-Kristensen et al. 2018) and may contribute to 'leaky gut' syndrome and contribute to the low-grade systemic inflammation reported in ADHD (paper.txt, line 521).

### Butyrate and Neuroinflammation Reduction

Butyrate has anti-inflammatory effects, potentially reducing neuroinflammation associated with ADHD (Yunting Li et al. 2024). Butyrate supports mitochondrial function, enhancing brain energy metabolism, which may help with cognitive impairments seen in ADHD (Rose et al. 2018) while also aiding in reducing cholesterol and neuroinflammation (Cavaliere et al. 2022) (paper.txt, lines 525-526).

Propionate research suggests that increased propionate levels could help reduce neuroinflammation (Grüter et al. 2023) and enhance cognitive function while protecting the blood-brain barrier (Hoyles et al. 2018) and stimulate the secretion of norepinephrine, possibly benefiting ADHD symptoms like attention and focus (paper.txt, line 527).

## Antioxidant Networks

### The Antioxidant Network Concept

While the body has multiple endogenous antioxidant defenses, including enzymes like superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase, these can become overwhelmed in states of chronic inflammation, nutrient deficiency, or high metabolic demand. Lester Packer introduced the concept of the "antioxidant network" (Packer et al. 1997), detailing how key compounds like vitamin E, vitamin C, lipoic acid, glutathione, and CoQ10 have been shown to work synergistically and regenerate each other in vivo (paper.txt, line 624).

Although high-dose antioxidant supplements have shown inconsistent or even harmful effects in the rare case of the Vitamin E clinical trials and prostate cancer (Klein et al. 2011), diets rich in natural antioxidant compounds have demonstrated robust benefits. The Green Mediterranean Diet DIRECT-PLUS studies, led to significantly greater reductions in visceral adipose (Zelicha et al. 2022) and neuroprotective effects (Pachter et al. 2024). This effect was accompanied by increases in microbiome-derived metabolites like urolithin A, reinforcing the synergistic role of polyphenols, fibre, and gut-derived antioxidants in improving metabolic and cognitive resilience (paper.txt, line 625).

### BRAIN Diet Framework

The framework of the BRAIN Diet embraces:

- The acknowledge of the theoretical strength of the antioxidant network i.e. working many different antioxidants into the diet and precursors for endogenous antioxidants
- Emphasize food-based sources rich in polyphenols, flavonoids, and balanced antioxidants.
- Avoid promoting high-dose single-nutrient supplementation unless there's clinical justification and consultation and agreement with healthcare professionals
- Highlight synergy in whole-foods, not megadoses of any one food source (paper.txt, lines 626-630).

### Complex Antioxidant Networks and Mineral Cofactors

There are many scientific findings supporting dietary antioxidant treatment of ADHD which accounted for substantial alterations in the immune system, epigenetic regulation of gene expression, and oxidative stress regulation in ADHD and also how immune dysfunction results in increased IgE levels and allergies, another link between ADHD (A. Verlaet et al. 2018; Wesselink et al. 2019b).

By supplying a spectrum of antioxidants (vitamins C and E, polyphenols, carotenoids, and omega 3 alongside mitochondrial supports (CoQ₁₀, lipoic acid, B-vitamins, k2) and trace minerals (selenium, zinc, copper), we can potentially increase the protection of neurons, preserve mitochondrial energy production, and reduce harmful inflammatory cascades, creating a better basis for optimal cognitive and emotional resilience (paper.txt, lines 632-634).

The antioxidant family also includes essential minerals that serve as cofactors for antioxidant enzymes. Selenium, zinc, and manganese, for instance, are crucial for the proper functioning of various antioxidant systems within the body (Mocchegiani and Malavolta 2019). This intricate network of antioxidants works synergistically (Vertuani, Angusti, and Manfredini 2004), with each component complementing the others to maintain cellular health and prevent oxidative damage (paper.txt, lines 636-638).

## Key Antioxidant Compounds

### Isothiocyanates (Sulforaphane)

Isothiocyanates (ITCs) like sulforaphane, created through enzymatic activity from glucoraphanin in broccoli, have also shown promising results in reducing oxidative stress and offering protection against various chronic diseases, including cancer and cardiovascular disorders while also showing higher bioavailability than other polyphenol-based dietary supplements that also activate Nrf2 (Houghton, Fassett, and Coombes 2016) (paper.txt, line 640).

### Phenolic Acids (Ferulic Acid)

Phenolic acids represent some of the most abundant antioxidants in plant-based foods, with whole grains and bran being especially rich sources. Among these, ferulic acid stands out as a key compound illustrating how food matrix effects translate into brain resilience. Processing methods such as sprouting and fermentation profoundly shape polyphenol bioavailability releasing bound ferulic acid, and enhancing bioavailability.

Once ferulic acid is absorbed, it crosses the blood–brain barrier, scavenges reactive oxygen species, and synergizes with vitamins C and E to stabilize neuronal membranes and preserve DHA. Such mechanisms highlight why dietary patterns emphasizing whole, minimally processed grains may deliver neuroprotective effects beyond their macronutrient profile (Shi et al. 2021) (paper.txt, lines 642-645).

### Carotenoids

Carotenoids, particularly lutein, zeaxanthin, and β-carotene, play a neuroprotective role through their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. These fat-soluble pigments accumulate selectively in neural tissues, including the retina and brain, where they help scavenge reactive oxygen species and stabilize cell membranes (Johnson 2014). Lutein and zeaxanthin, for instance, have been associated with improved cognitive performance, especially in domains such as memory, processing speed, and visual-spatial function (Yagi et al. 2021) (Lieblein-Boff et al., 2015; Vishwanathan et al., 2014). β-carotene, as both an antioxidant and vitamin A precursor, also supports immune regulation and neuronal development (paper.txt, line 647).

### Quercetin

Quercetin is an effective antioxidant agent which scavenges ROS (Boots, Haenen, and Bast 2008) and has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-neuroinflammatory and neuroprotective properties (Tongjaroenbuangam et al. 2011). Isoquercetin (glycosylated quercetin) is more completely absorbed than quercetin in the aglycone form, and that the simultaneous ingestion of quercetin with vitamin C, folate and additional flavonoids improves bioavailability (Y. Li et al. 2016). Also studies have shown quercetin bound to a sugar molecule forming quercitrin has anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects may be augmented by the co-ingestion of N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and olive oil (Camuesco et al. 2006) (paper.txt, line 675).

The estimated flavonoid intake ranges from 50 to 800 mg/day (About 75% of dietary polyphenol count is quercetin (Y. Li et al. 2016)). It is abundant in capers (Neveu V et al database 2010), apples, onions, berries, kale and soybeans (paper.txt, line 676).

### Genistein

Genistein a soy-derived isoflavonoid, has shown potential as a modulator of several biochemical pathways, including the endocannabinoid system and neuroinflammation (Fuloria et al. 2022), potentially enhancing the activity of certain endocannabinoids like anandamide (Thors, Eriksson, and Fowler 2007). It has been confirmed to have the ability to alleviate the deleterious effects of oxidative stress on neuronal injury, such as preventing neuronal death, increasing the production of hippocampal glutathione (GSH) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), and lowering lipid peroxidation, ROS, and nitric oxide production. Since genistein is believed to pass the blood–brain barrier to exert its neuroprotective effect, it is extensively applied in the investigation of the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Huntington's (Fuloria et al. 2022) (paper.txt, line 677).

### Glutathione

Glutathione (GSH) is one of the body's major antioxidants. Low levels may suggest oxidative stress; elevated GSH levels which have been recorded against ADHD subjects which may reflect a compensatory response to increased oxidative stress (Verlaet et al. 2019). Furthermore, mitochondrial metabolism of lactate depends on GSH for ROS neutralization, optimizing mitochondrial energy use (paper.txt, line 653).

## Dietary Sources of Contamination and Heavy Metals

### Heavy Metals and Oxidative Stress

Heavy metals are detoxified in the body by metallothionein (MT) metal carrier proteins that must bind with Zn and copper (Cu) (Zhai et al. 2015). In women, a high-fiber (vegetarian) pattern showed near-complete fecal recovery of dietary cadmium and no increase in blood/urine Cd despite higher Cd intake, suggesting fibre/phytate-mediated inhibition of absorption; low ferritin was the key predictor of higher body Cd (Berglund et al. 1994) (paper.txt, lines 658-659).

Repleting essential minerals (calcium, iron, zinc) together with dietary fibres, phytates, and polyphenols reduces gastrointestinal absorption of toxic metals (lead, cadmium, mercury, aluminium). This lowers systemic levels and blood–brain barrier transport, reduces brain metal accumulation, and ultimately decreases oxidative-stress burden and neurotransmission disruption (Zhai et al.) (Berglund et al. 1994) (paper.txt, lines 661-663).

ADHD has been linked with metals contamination and UPFs which contain among other additives high amounts of metals, particularly in food colourings; ADHD and other neuropsychiatric disorders have been also linked to maternal food habits such as high UPF consumption (Dufault et al. 2024). Besides heavy metals micro/nanoplastics (MNPs) are being linked to many diseases, reproductive health and ADHD; (Zhang et al. 2025). Anthocyanins, especially C3G-rich sources like berries, purple potatoes, and black goji, serve as:

- Natural chelation agents for heavy metals and environmental contaminants
- Neuroprotective molecules that support synaptic resilience and detox pathways
- Detox allies against microplastics and hormone-disrupting pollutants (paper.txt, lines 665-668).

Multiple meta-analyses (e.g. Nigg et al. 2016; Goodlad et al. 2013) show blood lead levels <5 µg/dL are associated with increased ADHD risk, even at "low" environmental levels. Lead interferes with prefrontal cortex development, synaptic pruning, and dopamine signaling. While ADHD is associated with higher oxidative stress and weaker antioxidant defense (e.g. reduced glutathione, increased lipid peroxidation). Metals will generate ROS, so this adds another layer of vulnerability (paper.txt, line 669).

Dietary patterns common in ADHD (e.g. low micronutrient density, irregular meals, high sugar/processed food intake) can increase absorption of toxic metals while also sometimes containing lower competing minerals like calcium, iron, and zinc which bind to toxic metals (Zhai et al. 2015). This leaning towards a poor Western diets, characterised as Western diets are characterized by excess consumption of saturated fats, over-refined sugars, and animal-based protein and low consumption of plant-based fiber, have been shown to have higher levels of oxidative stress and a greater risk of chronic disease (Jiang et al. 2021) (paper.txt, line 670).

## Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs) and Cooking Methods

Higher cooking temperature/time increases Maillard products/AGEs, elevating oxidative stress and microglial activation, which reduces synaptic plasticity. Favoring gentler cooking methods to limit AGE formation can better preserve neuronal function (Uribarri et al., 2010) (paper.txt, line 226).

Advanced Glycation & Lipoxidation End Products (AGEs / ALEs): High-heat cooking of fats and proteins produces AGEs/ALEs, which can cross the BBB, activate microglia, and impair synaptic plasticity—mechanisms implicated in cognitive decline (Uribarri et al. 2010) (paper.txt, line 203).

## Omega-3 Fatty Acids and Inflammation Resolution

In a controlled endotoxemia model (Ferguson et al. 2014), high-dose EPA+DHA (3.6 g/day) attenuated fever and downstream cytokines (IL-6, IL-10), even though TNF-α remained unchanged, suggesting that omega-3s reshape the resolution phase of acute inflammation rather than block its initiation. The endotoxemia model is discussed as an analogue of postprandial inflammation, which is highly relevant as we detail below ADHD is associated with metabolic disorders, and specifically linked to postprandial inflammation (Brown et al. 2025) (paper.txt, line 462).

## Integration with Other Systems

The BRAIN Diet targets this network by combining polyphenol-dense foods, omega-3s, sulfur amino acids (cysteine/glycine), and key cofactors (Se/Zn/Cu) with exposure control and gentler cooking to lower dietary AGE/ALE load. We treat oxidative stress as a state-sensitive, potentially modifiable contributor to symptom severity and predefine biomarkers to test whether lowering redox load improves outcomes (paper.txt, line 620).

These findings reinforce the importance of nutrient strategies within the BRAIN Diet that support NAD⁺ availability, glutathione synthesis, and mitochondrial health, such as niacin-rich foods (e.g., salmon, chicken breast, turkey, peanuts, and mushrooms), sulphur-containing vegetables that provide glutathione precursors (e.g., broccoli, Brussels sprouts, garlic, onions), and polyphenol-rich sources (e.g., blueberries, green tea, dark chocolate, extra virgin olive oil) (paper.txt, line 701).
