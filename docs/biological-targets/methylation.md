# Methylation

## Overview

Methylation is a fundamental biological process that serves as a critical target in the BRAIN Diet. This biochemical process involves the addition of methyl groups to DNA, proteins, and other molecules, playing a crucial role in gene expression, neurotransmitter synthesis, and overall brain health.

## Biological Implications

B vitamins, particularly B6, B2, folate (5-MTHF), and B12, are essential cofactors in the remethylation of homocysteine (Hcy) to methionine, which is subsequently converted to S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe).

A precursor to the key coenzymes FMN (Flavin mononucleotide) and FAD (Flavin adenine dinucleotide). FAD acts as a critical cofactor for MTHFR, linking riboflavin to homocysteine recycling and methylation capacity. Riboflavin coenzymes facilitate the metabolism also of B12, vitamin B6, and niacin.

Elevated plasma homocysteine, a byproduct of methylation, is frequently elevated in ADHD and other neurodegenerative disorders, cognitive impairment, and psychiatric conditions. Hcy is implicated in the induction of oxidative stress, the modulation of oxygen levels, and the initiation of lipid peroxidation pathway.

Trimethylglycine (TMG), also known as betaine, is a dietary methyl donor that helps recycle Hcy to methionine via an alternative pathway. Choline, a precursor to both TMG and phosphatidylcholine (PC), is similarly involved in homocysteine clearance and membrane phospholipid biosynthesis. These pathways are vulnerable to genetic variants such as MTHFR polymorphisms, which reduce the efficiency of folate cycling and methylation, thereby increasing susceptibility to cognitive dysfunction and ADHD-related symptoms (paper.txt, line 483).

Dietary patterns can modulate gene expression and epigenetic regulation through multiple pathways. Nutrients involved in one-carbon metabolism (e.g., folate, riboflavin, B12, choline) can influence methylation dynamics relevant to MTHFR and COMT activity. Polyphenols and omega-3 fatty acids have been shown to upregulate BDNF expression, potentially offsetting functional impacts of the common Val66Met polymorphism (paper.txt, line 484).

Research indicates that deficiencies in vitamins and minerals essential for methylation, such as folate, vitamin B12, and zinc, are correlated to ADHD symptoms and that supplementing these micronutrients has shown potential in supporting methylation and reducing symptom severity (paper.txt, line 245).
