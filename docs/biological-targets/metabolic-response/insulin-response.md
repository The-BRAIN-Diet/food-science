# Insulin Response

## Overview

Insulin response optimization is a critical biological target in the BRAIN Diet, focusing on maintaining stable blood glucose levels and improving insulin sensitivity to support cognitive function and reduce inflammation. ADHD and some other neuropsychiatric conditions (e.g., ASD, Bipolar and MDD) may represent a cluster of disorders influenced by brain-specific insulin dysregulation (Fanelli et al. 2022) (Fanelli et al., n.d.). Insulin plays a central role in brain function, modulating neurotransmitter balance, synaptic plasticity, and cellular energy metabolism (paper.txt, line 780).

## Role in Brain Health

### Glucose as Primary Brain Fuel

- **Brain consumes 20% of total glucose** despite being only 2% of body weight
- **Glucose is the primary energy source** for brain cells
- **Stable glucose levels** are essential for optimal cognitive function
- **Hypoglycemia can cause** confusion, irritability, and cognitive impairment
- Because the brain has limited capacity to store energy, maintaining a steady supply of glucose is essential for optimal cognitive function, unless a ketogenic dietary pattern is being followed, and risks have to be carefully assessed (Crosby et al. 2021) (paper.txt, line 489)

### Insulin and Cognitive Function

- **Insulin receptors** are present throughout the brain
- **Insulin resistance** is associated with cognitive decline and dementia
- **Insulin signaling** affects memory formation and synaptic plasticity
- **Chronic hyperglycemia** can damage blood vessels and impair brain circulation
- **Altered glucose uptake** has been observed in ADHD, with PET studies showing reduced metabolism in prefrontal and striatal regions (Zametkin et al. 1990) (paper.txt, line 782)

### Brain-Specific Insulin Dysregulation

ADHD and some other neuropsychiatric conditions (e.g., ASD, Bipolar and MDD) may represent a cluster of disorders influenced by brain-specific insulin dysregulation (Fanelli et al. 2022) (Fanelli et al., n.d.). Insulin plays a central role in brain function, modulating neurotransmitter balance, synaptic plasticity, and cellular energy metabolism. Beyond standard fasting glucose measures, continuous glucose monitoring (CGMs) offers novel insights into postprandial spikes and glycemic variability (paper.txt, line 780).

Consumer-driven interest in glucose monitoring has expanded rapidly, fueled both by digital health startups such as Levels Health and by public science communicators like Jessie Inchauspé ('Glucose Goddess'), whose popularization of 'glucose hacks' has reached millions, provides a growing body of real-world evidence on dietary strategies to blunt glucose excursions. This trend reflects a growing demand for personalized nutrition guided by real-time glucose data, even though clinical trial evidence remains limited (paper.txt, line 781).

## Mechanisms of Action

### Glucose Metabolism

- **Glycolysis**: Conversion of glucose to pyruvate for ATP production
- **Krebs cycle**: Complete oxidation of glucose for maximum energy yield
- **Oxidative phosphorylation**: Final step in ATP production
- **Glycogen storage**: Short-term glucose storage in liver and muscle
- **Thiamine (B1)** is essential for mitochondrial glucose metabolism in the brain leading to ATP production (Dhir et al. 2019) (paper.txt, line 710)

### Insulin Signaling

- **Glucose uptake**: Insulin facilitates glucose entry into cells
- **Glycogen synthesis**: Insulin promotes glucose storage
- **Protein synthesis**: Insulin supports neurotransmitter production
- **Anti-inflammatory effects**: Insulin has neuroprotective properties
- **Dopamine–insulin coupling**: Insulin signaling couples to dopamine tone; stabilizing post-prandial glucose supports motivation, attention, and impulse control

### Food Structure and Insulin Response

A classic milestone study by (Haber et al. 1977) demonstrated that apple juice induces a substantially greater postprandial insulin spike and lower satiety compared to either apple purée or the intact fruit, underscoring the role of food structure in metabolic responses. More recent work has extended these observations to the brain, linking attenuated glycemic excursions from intact food matrices to preserved brain insulin sensitivity, improved dopaminergic regulation, and more balanced reward processing (Gruber et al. 2023) (paper.txt, line 177).

**Cascade 2.1 - Preserving natural food structure** (e.g., an apple vs. processed forms) blunts post-prandial glycemic excursions, supports brain insulin sensitivity, and stabilizes dopamine–insulin coupling, mechanisms that may help regulate motivation and reduce impulsive behaviors (Haber et al. 1977) (Gruber et al. 2023) (paper.txt, line 180).

## Therapeutic Areas

### ADHD (Priority)

ADHD is linked with altered brain glucose metabolism and higher cardiometabolic risk. Managing glycemic variability stabilizes dopamine–insulin coupling and cognitive performance (paper.txt, line 49-52).

**Key Mechanisms:**
- **Higher rates of insulin resistance** in ADHD populations
- **Glucose dysregulation** may contribute to attention difficulties
- **Stable blood sugar** supports sustained attention and focus
- **Meal timing** affects ADHD symptom severity
- **Postprandial inflammation** - ADHD is associated with metabolic disorders, and specifically linked to postprandial inflammation (Brown et al. 2025) (paper.txt, line 462)
- **Dopamine–insulin coupling** - The BRAIN Diet uses nutrient-timed meals to support this transition through dopamine precursors and anti-inflammatory nutrients to reduce DMN dysregulation (Marsland et al. 2017) (paper.txt, line 306)

**Metabolic Overlaps Between ADHD and Systemic Dysfunction:**
While epidemiological studies (Di Girolamo et al. 2022) suggest the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in adults with ADHD (~10.8% under 60) does not exceed general population norms, there is substantial evidence of mechanistic overlap. ADHD often co-occurs with obesity, insulin resistance, and dysglycemia with shared pathophysiological pathways include dopaminergic reward circuit impairment, HPA-axis disturbances, chronic low-grade inflammation, and oxidative stress (Marcelli et al. 2025). These pathways create reciprocal vulnerability: metabolic dysfunction amplifies ADHD symptoms, and ADHD behaviors and lifestyles (poor diet, stress reactivity, irregular sleep) worsen metabolic risk and ADHD symptoms (paper.txt, line 777).

**Prenatal Exposures:**
Prenatal exposures further highlight the metabolic link. Maternal diabetes is associated with significantly increased ADHD risk in offspring, with meta-analyses estimating a 44% increase overall (Guo et al. 2020) and higher risk for pre-existing diabetes compared to gestational diabetes (Damtie et al. 2025). Chronic maternal hyperglycemia and inflammation during neurodevelopment likely underpin this effect (Wimberley et al. 2024) (paper.txt, line 778).

**Actionable Dietary Focuses for ADHD:**
- Preserve whole-food structure; order meals vegetables → protein/fat → carbohydrate
- Pair carbohydrates with fiber/fat/protein
- Consider CGM-guided personalization where available
- Prioritize protein-rich, circadian-aligned breakfasts with adequate tyrosine/tryptophan and choline sources
- Regular EPA/DHA intake (oily fish or algal oil) to support membrane fluidity and reduce inflammation

### Depression and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)

Metabolic endotoxemia (ME), defined as chronically elevated circulating lipopolysaccharide (LPS), is very common. Even modest elevations in LPS can sustain low-grade inflammation, impair insulin sensitivity, and promote neuroinflammatory cascades that compromise dopamine signaling and cognitive resilience. That inflammation has also been linked to disrupting dopamine and serotonin pathways and causing depression (Batey et al. 2024) (paper.txt, line 511).

**Key Mechanisms:**
- **Insulin resistance** and metabolic dysfunction are common in MDD
- **Inflammation** - LPS-driven inflammation disrupts dopamine and serotonin pathways
- **Gut-brain axis** - SIBO and gut barrier dysfunction impair nutrient absorption and contribute to inflammation
- **Omega-3s** - High-dose EPA+DHA (3.6 g/day) attenuated fever and downstream cytokines (IL-6, IL-10), reshaping the resolution phase of acute inflammation (Ferguson et al. 2014) (paper.txt, line 462)

**Actionable Dietary Focuses for MDD:**
- Support gut barrier integrity with fiber, polyphenols, and fermented foods
- Regular omega-3 intake (EPA/DHA) for anti-inflammatory effects
- Stabilize glycemic variability to support neurotransmitter balance
- Address SIBO if present to improve nutrient absorption

### Anxiety and General Anxiety Disorder (GAD)

Many of the nutritional strategies discussed in this paper—such as glycemic stabilization, SCFA production, polyphenol intake, and anxiolytic probiotic interventions—are expected to exert downstream effects on emotional regulation through modulation of HPA axis activity, limbic signalling, and neurotransmitter systems (paper.txt, line 335).

**Key Mechanisms:**
- **Glycemic stabilization** reduces anxiety through stable energy and neurotransmitter support
- **HPA axis modulation** - Dietary strategies can buffer stress responses
- **GABA support** - Probiotic interventions and GABA precursors support inhibitory neurotransmission
- **Vagal tone** - Omega-3s improve vagal tone and HRV control, reducing anxiety (Sauder et al. 2013) (paper.txt, line 796)

**Actionable Dietary Focuses for GAD:**
- Stabilize blood glucose with whole foods and proper meal timing
- Support GABA with fermented foods, magnesium, and taurine
- Include omega-3s for vagal tone improvement
- Reduce inflammatory load with polyphenol-rich foods

### Bipolar Disorder

ADHD and some other neuropsychiatric conditions (e.g., ASD, **Bipolar** and MDD) may represent a cluster of disorders influenced by brain-specific insulin dysregulation (Fanelli et al. 2022) (Fanelli et al., n.d.) (paper.txt, line 780).

**Key Mechanisms:**
- **Insulin dysregulation** is common in bipolar disorder
- **Metabolic syndrome** risk is elevated
- **Circadian disruption** affects glucose metabolism

### Alzheimer's Disease and Cognitive Decline

- **Insulin resistance** is associated with cognitive decline and dementia
- **Brain insulin sensitivity** - Preserved brain insulin sensitivity supports cognitive function
- **Glycemic control** - The Green Mediterranean Diet study showed MED/green-MED attenuated brain atrophy by ~50%, with glycemic control contributing to the neuroprotective signal (Pachter et al. 2024) (paper.txt, line 790)

## Metabolic Dysregulation and Shared Pathways

### Shared Pathophysiological Pathways

Shared pathways with metabolic disorders—insulin resistance, visceral adiposity, chronic inflammation, and oxidative stress—highlight ADHD as part of a broader spectrum of neuro-metabolic vulnerability (paper.txt, line 815).

Neurodevelopmental disorders such as ADHD, ASD, and bipolar disorder, and neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, have complex, multifactorial origins. Although the precise causes are not fully understood, these conditions share overlapping biological dysfunctions, including mitochondrial impairment, chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, impaired methylation, gut–brain axis disruption, **glucose dysregulation**, micronutrient deficiencies, and neurotransmitter imbalances (paper.txt, line 132).

### Adipose Tissue and Metabolic Load

Adipose tissue further links metabolic health with brain function. Dysfunctional visceral adipose depots release pro-inflammatory cytokines that cross the blood–brain barrier and disrupt neurotransmission (Marx et al. 2004). Nuclear receptors such as PPAR-α and PPAR-γ, which regulate fatty acid oxidation, insulin sensitivity, and adipokine release, are central to this process. Omega-3 fatty acids act as partial agonists of PPARs, promoting mitochondrial efficiency and anti-inflammatory signaling. Their activation shifts adipose tissue toward a metabolically protective phenotype, with downstream benefits for neuroimmune stability (Corona and Duchen 2016) (paper.txt, line 788).

The Green Mediterranean Diet study produced greater visceral adipose tissue (VAT) loss than MED or control (≈ −14.1% vs −6.0% vs −4.2%); VAT loss tracked with higher total plasma polyphenols and with the microbiome-derived markers urolithin A (via ellagitannins: walnuts/pomegranate) and hippuric acid Green tea catechins (e.g., EGCG, EGC). Proteomics suggest VAT reduction is accompanied by shifts in adiposity-related pathways. Parallel analyses (Pachter et al. 2024) showed MED/green-MED attenuated brain atrophy by ~50%, with glycemic control contributing to the neuroprotective signal, consistent with a polyphenol–fibre–microbiome synergy improving metabolic and brain aging phenotypes (paper.txt, line 790).

### Gut Permeability and LPS

Beyond adipose-derived cytokines, microbial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) (Mohammad and Thiemermann 2021) can enter systemic circulation through increased gut permeability, amplifying low-grade inflammation and impairing insulin sensitivity. Dietary polyphenols, prebiotic fibres, and lactobacilli strains have been shown to reduce LPS translocation and neutralize its inflammatory signaling, underscoring the microbiome's role in HPA–ANS stability (paper.txt, line 789).

When these weaknesses converge, lipopolysaccharide (LPS, a bacterial endotoxin) crosses into the bloodstream, fueling systemic inflammation, impairing insulin sensitivity (Mohammad and Thiemermann 2021) (paper.txt, line 511).

## Nutritional Strategies

### Complex Carbohydrates and Fiber

Carbohydrate selection is critical to regulating core biological processes relevant to brain function. Poor carbohydrate choices may contribute to insulin dysregulation, inflammation, obesity, and other metabolic disorders (Cho and Choi 2021) (paper.txt, line 489).

The inclusion of complex carbohydrates and fermentable fibres plays a central role in supporting metabolic health and brain function. Complex carbohydrates consist of long chains of sugar molecules, such as starch and fibre, that digest more slowly, providing a steady release of glucose. Key sources include whole grains (including pseudo grains like quinoa and buckwheat, grains like barley and oats), fibrous vegetables, and legumes such as lentils and chickpeas. In parallel, both soluble fibre (from apples, oats, flaxseeds) and insoluble fibre (from vegetables, nuts, and whole grains) support digestive health, glycemic control, and microbial diversity, factors increasingly linked to improved cognition, emotional regulation, and long-term neuroprotection (Massimino et al. 1998) (paper.txt, line 491).

### Resistant Starch

The complex carbohydrate, Resistant Starch, forms when certain starchy foods are cooked and then cooled, a process called retrogradation. Foods like rice and potatoes develop higher resistant starch content when chilled, and reheating does not reverse this effect. One example: white rice was cooled and reheated showing a rise in RS content from 0.64 to 1.65 g/100 g and elicited a lower glycemic response (Yunting Li et al. 2024) (paper.txt, line 492).

### Low Glycemic Index Foods

- **Whole grains**: Quinoa, brown rice, oats (steel-cut or rolled)
- **Legumes**: Lentils, chickpeas, black beans
- **Non-starchy vegetables**: Leafy greens, cruciferous vegetables
- **Nuts and seeds**: Almonds, walnuts, chia seeds

### Fiber-Rich Foods

- **Soluble fiber**: Slows glucose absorption and improves insulin sensitivity
- **Insoluble fiber**: Supports gut health and satiety
- **Prebiotic fiber**: Feeds beneficial gut bacteria
- **Sources**: Oats, barley, legumes, fruits with skin

### Healthy Fats

- **Monounsaturated fats**: Olive oil, avocados, nuts
- **Omega-3 fatty acids**: Fatty fish, flaxseeds, walnuts
- **Medium-chain triglycerides**: Coconut oil, MCT oil
- **Avoid trans fats**: Limit processed and fried foods

### Added Sugars and Metabolic Dysfunction

Beyond circadian disruption (see Section 9), chronic consumption of added sugars, particularly fructose-containing sweeteners such as sucrose and high-fructose corn syrup, exerts unique metabolic stress (Stanhope 2016). Randomised trials show sugar-sweetened beverage intake drives dose-dependent increases in visceral adiposity, dyslipidaemia, and insulin resistance, even independent of weight gain (Sampasa-Kanyinga et al. 2018). For ADHD populations already vulnerable to glucose variability and reward-driven eating, high sugar intake may compound both metabolic and neurocognitive dysregulation. As discussed above (Section 3 – Food Matrix) sugars delivered within whole foods such as fruit or dairy are buffered by fibre, polyphenols, and micronutrients, producing more stable glycaemic responses (paper.txt, line 784).

**Emerging Alternatives:**
Emerging alternatives such as allulose, stevia, and monk fruit extracts offer sweetness with negligible impact on glucose. In studies Allulose has been shown to reliably attenuates postprandial glycaemia in healthy humans, even at modest doses (5–10 g per meal) (Tani et al. 2023) (paper.txt, line 785).

## Food Timing Strategies

### Circadian Alignment

- **Larger meals earlier in the day** when insulin sensitivity is higher
- **Smaller, protein-rich meals** in the evening
- **Avoid late-night eating** to support natural insulin rhythms
- **Consistent meal timing** to regulate circadian metabolism
- **Adipose tissue insulin sensitivity** is up to 54% higher at noon than at midnight (Poggiogalle et al. 2018) (paper.txt, line 843)

Earlier and more consistent eating windows are associated with improved weight and glycaemic outcomes (Franzago et al. 2023) (J. Liu et al. 2023). These benefits are partly explained by circadian biology in that adipose tissue insulin sensitivity is up to 54% higher at noon than at midnight (Poggiogalle et al. 2018) (paper.txt, line 843).

### Meal Composition

- **Protein + fiber + healthy fats** with each meal
- **Avoid isolated carbohydrates** without protein or fat
- **Include vinegar or lemon** to help lower glycemic response
- **Space meals 4-5 hours apart** for optimal insulin sensitivity
- **Meal sequencing**: vegetables → protein → carbohydrate can meaningfully reduce glycemic variability (paper.txt, line 781)

### Chrono-Nutrition

Aligning nutrient intake with circadian and activity rhythms represents the science of chrono-nutrition which if followed can represent lower metabolic stress if we eat in line our biological clock. Failing to do so is associated with increased adiposity, T2DM, and cardiometabolic risk factors. Chrono-nutrition is based on three different dimensions of eating behavior, including timing, frequency, and regularity (Franzago et al. 2023) (paper.txt, line 823).

In ADHD, where appetite suppression from medications (Nancy Clark 2022), irregular eating, and sleep disruption are common, timing nutrients appropriately may optimize energy regulation, neurotransmitter production and cognitive function (paper.txt, line 824).

## Specific Foods for Insulin Optimization

### Insulin-Sensitizing Foods

- **Cinnamon**: May improve insulin sensitivity (1–3 g/day cassia or Ceylon cinnamon powder) (Anderson et al., 2004; Khan et al., 2003) (paper.txt, line 919)
- **Apple cider vinegar**: Helps lower post-meal glucose
- **Green tea**: Contains compounds that support glucose metabolism
- **Turmeric**: Anti-inflammatory effects may improve insulin function
- **Berberine**: Supports glucose regulation (paper.txt, line 803)

### Chromium-Rich Foods

- **Broccoli**: High in chromium, supports insulin function
- **Grape juice**: Natural source of chromium
- **Whole grains**: Provide chromium and other insulin-supporting nutrients
- **Nuts**: Especially Brazil nuts and almonds
