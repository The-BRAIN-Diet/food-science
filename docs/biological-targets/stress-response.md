# Metabolic & Neuroendocrine Stress (HPA Axis & ANS)

**Whole-body regulation layer** — stress allocation, autonomic tone, hormonal coordination and energy prioritisation.

## Overview

The stress response is a complex physiological system that plays a crucial role in brain health and cognitive function. The neuroendocrine and autonomic systems, together with the Enteric Nervous System (ENS), form a tightly interwoven network regulating stress responses, metabolism, and gut–brain communication. The hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis orchestrates cortisol rhythms and systemic stress signaling, while the autonomic nervous system (ANS) integrates sympathetic "fight-or-flight" activity with parasympathetic recovery pathways. Within this circuitry, the sympatho-adreno-medullary (SAM) axis represents the most immediate arm, releasing adrenaline and noradrenaline within seconds of a stressor (paper.txt, line 769).

## Biological Implications

The neuroendocrine and autonomic systems, together with the Enteric Nervous System (ENS), form a tightly interwoven network regulating stress responses, metabolism, and gut–brain communication. These overlapping systems mediate key feedback loops between diet, inflammation, and brain function, and are highly responsive to circadian and nutritional inputs (paper.txt, line 769).

In ADHD, stress circuitry is often dysregulated. Children with sensory over-responsivity show prolonged sympathetic arousal and sustained cortisol elevations, suggesting compounded dysregulation of SAM and HPA systems. Epidemiological findings link this to clinical fatigue: while ~20% of the general population report clinically relevant fatigue, the rate in ADHD is ~62%. ADHD burnout may therefore arise from sustained sympathetic drive combined with blunted cortisol recovery, leading to chronic exhaustion (paper.txt, line 771).

Cortisol profiles in ADHD are frequently abnormal, including blunted cortisol awakening responses and flattened daily rhythms. Genetic variation in HPA-axis regulators, including NR3C1 polymorphisms, further supports a heritable component to stress dysregulation. These hormonal irregularities can invoke many ADHD related symptoms such as poor resilience, amplified impulsivity and anxiety, and impaired decision-making (paper.txt, line 774).

Many of the nutritional strategies discussed in this paper—such as glycemic stabilization, SCFA production, polyphenol intake, and anxiolytic probiotic interventions—are expected to exert downstream effects on emotional regulation through modulation of HPA axis activity, limbic signalling, and neurotransmitter systems (paper.txt, line 335).

Omega-3s (EPA/DHA) improve vagal tone and HRV control, improving cortisol rhythms and inflammation, BDNF signaling (paper.txt, line 796).
