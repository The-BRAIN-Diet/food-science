# Biological Targets for Brain Health

The BRAIN Diet addresses 6 key biological targets that are commonly disrupted in ADHD, depression, cognitive decline, and other neurocognitive disorders. Each target represents a critical system that can be optimized through precision nutrition.

## The 6 Biological Targets

### [Insulin Response](./insulin-response.md)

Optimizing glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity to support stable energy and cognitive function.

### [Gut Microbiome](./gut-microbiome.md)

Supporting beneficial gut bacteria and the gut-brain axis through psychobiotic and prebiotic foods.

### [Hormonal Response](./hormonal-response.md)

Balancing stress hormones, sex hormones, and other endocrine factors that influence brain function.

### [Methylation](./methylation.md)

Supporting DNA methylation processes and one-carbon metabolism for optimal gene expression and neurotransmitter synthesis.

### [Endocannabinoid System (ECS)](./endocannabinoid-system.md)

Modulating the body's natural cannabinoid system for mood, appetite, and neuroprotection.

### [Mitochondrial Support](./mitochondrial-support.md)

Enhancing cellular energy production and reducing oxidative stress in brain cells.

### [Neurochemical Balance](./neurochemical-balance.md)

Optimizing neurotransmitter synthesis, release, and reuptake for improved cognitive function.

## Integration Strategy

The BRAIN Diet takes a **systems approach** by:

- **Addressing multiple targets simultaneously** rather than focusing on single nutrients
- **Using food matrix strategies** that naturally support multiple systems
- **Leveraging nutrient synergies** for enhanced effectiveness
- **Providing both omnivore and plant-based approaches** for flexibility

## Key Principles

### 1. Food-First Approach

- **Whole foods** provide complex nutrient matrices
- **Natural combinations** enhance bioavailability
- **Minimal processing** preserves nutrient integrity

### 2. Precision Nutrition

- **Individual variation** in nutrient needs and genetic factors
- **Targeted interventions** based on specific biological dysfunctions
- **Comprehensive assessment** of multiple systems

### 3. Circadian Alignment

- **Meal timing** that supports natural biological rhythms
- **Nutrient timing** for optimal absorption and utilization
- **Sleep-wake cycle** optimization

## Research Foundation

Each biological target is supported by:

- **Peer-reviewed research** on nutritional interventions
- **Clinical studies** in relevant populations
- **Mechanistic understanding** of biological pathways
- **Practical implementation** strategies

## Notes

This biological targets framework provides the scientific foundation for the BRAIN Diet's approach to supporting brain health through precision nutrition. Each target page includes detailed information about the biological system, nutritional strategies, and practical implementation within the diet framework.
