# Biological Targets for Brain Health

The BRAIN Diet is built around **6 BRAIN Biological Regulatory Systems (BRS)** that are commonly disrupted in ADHD, depression, cognitive decline, and other neurocognitive disorders. Each BRS represents a critical regulatory layer that can be supported through precision nutrition.

## BRAIN Biological Regulatory Systems (BRS)

1. **Neurotransmitter Regulation** — *Signal layer*: synaptic communication, circuit dynamics, behavioural expression.
2. **Methylation & One-Carbon Metabolism** — *Biochemical regulation layer*: synthesis, repair, epigenetic control, neurotransmitter production.
3. **Inflammation & Oxidative Stress** — *Immune/redox regulation layer*: cellular protection, repair processes, inflammatory signalling tone.
4. **Mitochondrial Function & Bioenergetics** — *Capacity layer*: ATP production, metabolic resilience, oxidative phosphorylation efficiency.
5. **Gut–Brain Axis & Enteric Nervous System (ENS)** — *Peripheral neural–immune interface*: microbial metabolites, vagal signalling, immune–metabolic integration.
6. **Metabolic & Neuroendocrine Stress (HPA Axis & ANS)** — *Whole-body regulation layer*: stress allocation, autonomic tone, hormonal coordination and energy prioritisation.

### Modulators (cross-cutting)

**Endocannabinoid System (ECS)** and **Circadian Rhythm** act as modulators across all six BRS. Substances, foods, and recipes tagged with **Endocannabinoid System** or **Circadian Rhythm** are integrated into every BRS section in therapeutic-area matrices and food spreadsheets, so their cross-cutting role is visible. Tag content with these when it supports ECS or circadian alignment; the site logic includes them in all relevant matrix tables.

## Integration Strategy

The BRAIN Diet takes a **systems approach** by:

- **Addressing multiple targets simultaneously** rather than focusing on single nutrients
- **Using food matrix strategies** that naturally support multiple systems
- **Leveraging nutrient synergies** for enhanced effectiveness
- **Providing both omnivore and plant-based approaches** for flexibility

## Key Principles

### 1. Food-First Approach

- **Whole foods** provide complex nutrient matrices
- **Natural combinations** enhance bioavailability
- **Minimal processing** preserves nutrient integrity

### 2. Precision Nutrition

- **Individual variation** in nutrient needs and genetic factors
- **Targeted interventions** based on specific biological dysfunctions
- **Comprehensive assessment** of multiple systems

### 3. Circadian Alignment

- **Meal timing** that supports natural biological rhythms
- **Nutrient timing** for optimal absorption and utilization
- **Sleep-wake cycle** optimization

## Research Foundation

Each biological target is supported by:

- **Peer-reviewed research** on nutritional interventions
- **Clinical studies** in relevant populations
- **Mechanistic understanding** of biological pathways
- **Practical implementation** strategies

## Notes

This biological targets framework provides the scientific foundation for the BRAIN Diet's approach to supporting brain health through precision nutrition. Each target page includes detailed information about the biological system, nutritional strategies, and practical implementation within the diet framework.
