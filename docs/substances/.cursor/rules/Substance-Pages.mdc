description: Format of a Substance Page (Bioactive, Metabolite, Nutrient)
globs: *.md

---

- Tag each food page with the substances it contains
- Tag the page with "Substance" too, so that it appears in index.md.
- Tag with "Bioactive", "Metabolite", "Nutrient" and any other substance classifications such as "Mineral", "Vitamin", "Fatty Acid" etc.
- Tag each page with the name of the biological targets (e.g. Hormonal Response) so we can refer to it from a biological target page.
- Tag with the tags for any foods that contain this substance.
- In the front matter, list_image: one of /img/icons/substance.svg /img/icons/nutrient.svg /img/icons/metabolite.svg /img/icons/bioactive.svg

- Have a section of front-matter called mechanisms, which explains how the substance interacts with the Biological Targets. Use paper.txt for research. Example:

```
mechanisms:
  Inflammation: Specialized Pro-Resolving Mediators (SPMs) - resolvins, protectins, maresins terminate inflammation without immunosuppression, downregulate COX-2, inhibit neutrophil infiltration, enhance macrophage clearance, limit glutamate-induced excitotoxicity
```

The Format of the page should have this structure:

- Overview: A single paragraph description describing the substance, what it is, where it comes from. Keep it brief.
- Recipes: should be <TagList tag="the substance" filter="recipes" />
- Biological Mechanisms and Implications: should be: <SubstanceMatrix tag="the substance" />
- Foods: should be <TagList tag="the substance" filter="foods" />
- References: A list of findings or scientific principles, with their link to the `/docs/papers/BRAIN-Diet-References#<ref>` that discusses it, from paper.txt in the root directory. Make sure all assertions are backed up by evidence from the paper.txt file . Use references if the paper mentions them.

An example for the references section might look like this:

- A decreased microbial diversity (alpha diversity) has also been reported in ADHD [Prehn-Kristensen et al. 2018](/docs/papers/BRAIN-Diet-References#prehn-kristensen_reduced_2018)

Use the `berberine.md` page as an example.
