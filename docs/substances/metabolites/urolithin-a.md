## Overview

Urolithin A is a gut microbiome-derived metabolite produced from ellagitannins (found in walnuts, pomegranates, berries). It supports mitochondrial resilience, mitophagy, and cognitive function. Production varies by individual gut microbiome composition, particularly Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio.

## From the paper

- "Urolithin A, a powerful antioxidant... was more successfully produced with those with increased gut biota Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio."
- "Higher polyphenol intake and microbial diversity increase urolithin A... supporting mitochondrial resilience and mitophagy and in turn improving cognitive endurance. Hypothesis: these effects may extend to executive function."
- The Green Mediterranean Diet study showed "greater visceral adipose tissue (VAT) loss... VAT loss tracked with higher total plasma polyphenols and with the microbiome-derived markers urolithin A (via ellagitannins: walnuts/pomegranate)."
- "Direct supplementation with Urolithin A overcomes limitations of dietary exposure and gut microbiome variability in healthy adults to achieve consistent levels across the population."

## Practical notes

- Dietary precursors: walnuts, pomegranates, berries (ellagitannins)
- Production depends on gut microbiome diversity and composition
- Direct supplementation available for those with limited production capacity
- Supports mitochondrial health and may improve cognitive endurance
