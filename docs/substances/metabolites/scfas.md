## Overview

SCFAs arise from fermentation of fibers and resistant starches, supporting gut barrier integrity, immune modulation, mitochondrial function, and in some cases crossing the BBB (e.g., butyrate).

## From the paper

- ADHD cohorts show lower SCFAs in some studies; butyrate supports mitochondrial metabolism and reduces neuroinflammation; propionate supports BBB integrity and may influence dopamine regulation.
