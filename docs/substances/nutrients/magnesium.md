## Overview

Magnesium is a broad cofactor for neurotransmitter synthesis and receptor modulation (e.g., NMDA, GABA), ATP production, and antioxidant defenses. Deficiency is common and linked to behavioral symptoms.

## Biological Roles

### Enzymatic Cofactor

Magnesium is involved in over 300 enzymatic reactions, particularly key in supporting neurochemical production, mitochondrial health and fighting pro-oxidants and supporting antioxidants (Zheltova et al. 2016) (paper.txt, line 718).

### Neurotransmitter Regulation

Magnesium also supports neurotransmitter regulation, especially GABA (an inhibitory neurotransmitter). Deficiency is common in those with ADHD and can exacerbate symptoms like irritability and attention difficulties (paper.txt, line 718).

Magnesium functions as an NMDA receptor antagonist and GABA receptor modulator (Clerc et al. 2013) (paper.txt, line 349).

### B6 Activation

B6 is a cofactor in the development of all the key neurotransmitters presented above (Table X). Only once pyridoxine (PIN), pyridoxal (PAL), pyridoxamine (PAM) (Spector 1978) cross the blood–brain barrier in their non-phosphorylated forms, can they be converted into pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP or P5P), the active coenzyme form. This means that systemic supplementation with PLP does not bypass the brain's reliance on its own enzymatic machinery. Instead, they require pyridoxal kinase (PDXK) activity, which is supported by cofactors such as **magnesium** and ATP (paper.txt, line 359).

In ADHD, genetic variations and enzymatic inefficiencies may influence PDXK activity and thus PLP availability, potentially impairing neurotransmitter synthesis. Clinical evidence supports this: combined B6 and magnesium supplementation has been reported to reduce inattention and hyperactivity (M Mousain-Bosc 1 2006) (Mousain-Bosc et al., 2006) (paper.txt, line 361).

### Neurotransmitter Support

**Glutamate:** Principal excitatory neurotransmitter; learning, memory, cognition and mood deficits. Cofactors: Glutamine (from protein), B6, **magnesium**, zinc. Food sources: Lentils, poultry, fish, spinach, pumpkin seeds. Maintain magnesium & antioxidant intake to prevent excitotoxicity; balance with GABA-supporting foods in evening (paper.txt, line 345).

**Serotonin:** Mood regulation, emotional control, impulse moderation. Cofactors: Tryptophan; B6, **magnesium**; carb co-ingestion to aid LAT1 transport. Food sources: Turkey, eggs, dairy, soy, seeds, oats, bananas. Pair tryptophan-rich proteins with moderate carbs to increase Trp:LNAA ratio; timing midday or evening for calming effect (paper.txt, line 348).

**GABA:** Main inhibitory neurotransmitter; calms neural activity, supports sleep. Cofactors: Glutamate (from protein), B6, **Magnesium functions as an NMDA receptor antagonist and GABA receptor modulator** ((Clerc et al. 2013)), Zinc – acts as an allosteric modulator of the GABA receptor ((Peralta and Huidobro-Toro 2016)) (paper.txt, line 349).

### Mitochondrial Health

Magnesium supports mitochondrial health and fighting pro-oxidants and supporting antioxidants (Zheltova et al. 2016) (paper.txt, line 718).

### Synergy with Other Nutrients

Supplementation with other compounds such as vitamin D have shown to significantly reduce behavioural problems be effective (Hemamy et al. 2020). Other studies have shown magnesium to be effective with both zinc and omega 3 and 6 (Huss, Völp, and Stauss-Grabo 2010) (paper.txt, line 718).

Sourdough bread, especially quinoa sourdough, provides high magnesium content. Table 7 from the paper shows sourdough containing 303.43 mg/100g magnesium, providing 72-98% of RDA per 100g (paper.txt, lines 540-545).

## Deficiency and ADHD

Deficiency is common in those with ADHD and can exacerbate symptoms like irritability and attention difficulties (paper.txt, line 718).

## Supplementation Considerations

- **Combined B6 and magnesium** supplementation has been reported to reduce inattention and hyperactivity (M Mousain-Bosc 1 2006) (Mousain-Bosc et al., 2006)
- **Synergy with vitamin D** - Supplementation with other compounds such as vitamin D have shown to significantly reduce behavioural problems be effective (Hemamy et al. 2020)
- **Synergy with zinc and omega-3** - Other studies have shown magnesium to be effective with both zinc and omega 3 and 6 (Huss, Völp, and Stauss-Grabo 2010)

## Practical Notes

- Sources: leafy greens, legumes, nuts, seeds, whole grains

- **Boil leafy greens** (spinach, kale) to reduce oxalates that can bind magnesium
- Pair with **vitamin D** sources for enhanced benefits
- Consider **mineral water** as a source
- **Sourdough bread** (especially quinoa) provides high magnesium content
