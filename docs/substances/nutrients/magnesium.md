## Overview

Magnesium is a broad cofactor for neurotransmitter synthesis and receptor modulation (e.g., NMDA, GABA), ATP production, and antioxidant defenses. Deficiency is common and linked to behavioral symptoms.

## From the paper

- “Magnesium… supports neurotransmitter regulation (notably GABA), mitochondrial health, and antioxidant defenses; combined with vitamin D reduced behavioral problems; synergy with zinc and omega‑3s reported.”

## Practical notes

- Sources: leafy greens, legumes, nuts, seeds, whole grains. Consider spread dosing and food‑first coverage.
