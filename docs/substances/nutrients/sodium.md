## Overview

Sodium is an essential electrolyte that plays a critical role in maintaining fluid balance, nerve function, and muscle contractions. It supports fluid balance, nerve impulse transmission, and muscle function, with balance between sodium and potassium being relevant for blood pressure and neuronal excitability. The BRAIN Diet emphasizes whole foods and minimal processing, which naturally helps control sodium intake by reducing reliance on heavily processed foods that often contain high levels of added salt.
