# Sodium

## Overview

Sodium is an essential electrolyte that plays a critical role in maintaining fluid balance, nerve function, and muscle contractions. Sodium supports fluid balance, nerve impulse transmission, and muscle function; balance with potassium is relevant for blood pressure and neuronal excitability. While the paper doesn't provide extensive specific details about sodium, it's mentioned in the context of overall dietary balance and cardiovascular health.

## Role in Brain Health

Sodium is essential for:

- Maintaining proper fluid balance in the brain
- Supporting nerve impulse transmission
- Regulating blood pressure
- Supporting cognitive function

## Dietary Considerations

### Sources

- Table salt (sodium chloride)
- Processed foods
- Natural sources in some vegetables and dairy products

### Recommendations

- Follow standard dietary guidelines for sodium intake
- Balance with potassium intake for optimal cardiovascular health
- Consider individual health conditions and blood pressure status

## Integration with BRAIN Diet

While sodium isn't specifically highlighted as a primary focus in the BRAIN diet framework, it's important to maintain appropriate sodium levels as part of overall electrolyte balance and cardiovascular health support.

## Notes

The BRAIN diet emphasizes whole foods and minimal processing, which naturally helps control sodium intake by reducing reliance on heavily processed foods that often contain high levels of added salt.
