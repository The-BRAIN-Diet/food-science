mechanisms:
  Gut Microbiome: Supports gut barrier integrity through collagen and gelatin synthesis; helps seal gut lining and reduce permeability; affects inflammation and gut-brain communication
  Neurochemical Balance: Acts as an inhibitory neurotransmitter; improves sleep latency and quality; supports GABA pathways and neurotransmitter balance
  Stress Response: Improves sleep latency and quality; supports stress resilience through improved sleep regulation
