mechanisms:
  Gut Microbiome: Supports gut barrier integrity through collagen and gelatin synthesis; helps seal gut lining and reduce permeability; affects inflammation and gut-brain communication
  Neurochemical Balance: Acts as an inhibitory neurotransmitter; improves sleep latency and quality; supports GABA pathways and neurotransmitter balance
  Stress Response: Improves sleep latency and quality; supports stress resilience through improved sleep regulation

## Overview

Glycine is a nonessential amino acid that serves multiple critical functions in brain health, gut integrity, and sleep regulation. As an inhibitory neurotransmitter, glycine helps calm neural activity and supports sleep onset. It is also a key component of collagen and gelatin, which are essential for gut barrier repair and connective tissue strength. Additionally, glycine is required for glutathione synthesis, supporting antioxidant defense and detoxification pathways.
