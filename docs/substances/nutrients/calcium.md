# Calcium

## Overview

Calcium is an essential mineral that plays a critical role in bone health, muscle function, and nerve transmission. Calcium supports skeletal integrity and neurotransmission; absorption and distribution depend on vitamin D and K2 status. While the paper doesn't provide extensive specific details about calcium, it's mentioned in the context of overall mineral balance and bone health.

## Role in Brain Health

Calcium is essential for:

- Supporting nerve impulse transmission
- Maintaining proper muscle function
- Supporting bone health and structure
- Contributing to cognitive function

## Dietary Considerations

### Sources

- Dairy products (milk, cheese, yogurt)
- Leafy green vegetables (kale, spinach, collard greens)
- Fortified plant-based milks
- Nuts and seeds (almonds, sesame seeds)
- Fish with edible bones (sardines, salmon)

### Recommendations

- Follow standard dietary guidelines for calcium intake
- Consider individual needs based on age, gender, and health status
- Ensure adequate vitamin D intake for optimal calcium absorption
- Balance with other minerals like magnesium and phosphorus

## Integration with BRAIN Diet

The BRAIN diet emphasizes nutrient-dense whole foods, many of which are excellent sources of calcium. The diet's focus on leafy green vegetables, nuts, and seeds provides plant-based calcium sources, while the omnivore version can include dairy products for additional calcium.

## Notes

The BRAIN diet's emphasis on whole foods and minimal processing naturally supports adequate calcium intake through diverse food sources, supporting both brain health and overall bone health.
