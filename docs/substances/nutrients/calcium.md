## Overview

Calcium is an essential mineral that plays a critical role in bone health, muscle function, and nerve transmission. It supports skeletal integrity and neurotransmission, with absorption and distribution depending on vitamin D and K2 status. Calcium, along with vitamin D, magnesium, taurine, phospholipids (phosphatidylserine), and flavonoids (quercetin), supports calcium modulation, insulin sensitivity, sympathetic arousal, and mitochondrial excitability. Phytates can bind essential minerals such as calcium, potentially impairing their absorption, though fermentation can reduce phytate content and improve mineral bioavailability. Fortified plant milks and dairy milk can help meet calcium targets when used judiciously.
