mechanisms:
  Hormonal Response: Supports calcium modulation along with vitamin D, magnesium, taurine, phospholipids, and flavonoids; supports insulin sensitivity, sympathetic arousal, and mitochondrial excitability
  Neurochemical Balance: Essential for nerve impulse transmission and neurotransmission

## References

- Calcium supports skeletal integrity and neurotransmission; absorption and distribution depend on vitamin D and K2 status
- Calcium Modulation: Vitamin D, magnesium, taurine, phospholipids (phosphatidylserine), flavonoids (quercetin) support insulin sensitivity, sympathetic arousal, and mitochondrial excitability
- Phytates can bind essential minerals such as calcium, potentially impairing their absorption; fermentation can reduce phytate content and improve bioavailability
- Fortified plant milks and dairy milk can help meet calcium targets when used judiciously
