mechanisms:
  Hormonal Response: Supports calcium modulation along with vitamin D, magnesium, taurine, and flavonoids; supports insulin sensitivity, sympathetic arousal, and mitochondrial excitability
  Stress Response: Supports membrane dynamics and signaling; used for cognition and stress modulation
  Neurochemical Balance: Supports neuronal membrane dynamics and signaling
