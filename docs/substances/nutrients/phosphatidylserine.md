## Overview

Phosphatidylserine (PS) is a neuronal membrane phospholipid that supports membrane dynamics and signaling. It is used for cognition and stress modulation and fits within the phospholipid support family alongside phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). PS, along with vitamin D, magnesium, taurine, and flavonoids, supports calcium modulation, insulin sensitivity, sympathetic arousal, and mitochondrial excitability.
