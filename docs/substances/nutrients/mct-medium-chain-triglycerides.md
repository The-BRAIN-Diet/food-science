mechanisms:
  Mitochondrial Support: MCTs are converted to ketones (beta-hydroxybutyrate) in the liver, which serve as an alternative energy substrate for mitochondria; ketones can be used by brain mitochondria when glucose metabolism is impaired, supporting ATP production and mitochondrial function
  Neurochemical Balance: Ketones produced from MCTs provide ATP through mitochondrial metabolism; ATP is essential for neurotransmitter synthesis, release, and reuptake, indirectly supporting neurochemical balance by ensuring adequate energy for neuronal function

## Overview

Medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) are fatty acids with chain lengths of 6-12 carbon atoms, primarily caprylic acid (C8) and capric acid (C10). Unlike long-chain fatty acids, MCTs are rapidly absorbed and transported directly to the liver where they are converted to ketones (beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate). These ketones serve as an alternative energy substrate for mitochondria, particularly important when glucose metabolism is impaired. MCTs provide rapid energy for the brain and support ketone production, making them valuable for brain energy metabolism.
