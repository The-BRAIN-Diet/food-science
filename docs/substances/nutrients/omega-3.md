## Overview

Omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA support neuronal membrane fluidity, neurotransmission, mitochondrial integrity, and active resolution of inflammation via specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs). They modulate nuclear receptors (PPARs), ion channels, and synaptic plasticity and interact with B-vitamins and methylation pathways.

## Biological Roles

### Brain Structure and Function

Lipids constitute 50–60% of brain dry weight; DHA ~14% of brain PUFA varies by region. Omega-3s influence gene expression, neurotransmission, inflammation resolution, and synaptic plasticity. Phospholipid-bound omega-3s (e.g., krill oil, fish roe) enhance brain DHA accretion via LPC transport; APOE4 carriers show reduced brain DHA uptake. SPMs (resolvins, protectins, maresins) terminate inflammation without immunosuppression and improve endothelial function.

Omega-3 fatty acids, particularly EPA and DHA, exert multifaceted effects on brain function that extend beyond their structural roles in neuronal membranes. Their actions influence gene expression, neurotransmission, inflammation resolution, and synaptic plasticity through a network of interrelated pathways. These include modulation of nuclear receptor signaling through PPAR proteins, support for phospholipid membrane dynamics, and the generation of specialized proresolving mediators (SPMs) that downregulate inflammatory responses (paper.txt, line 441).

### Membrane Phospholipids and Ion Channels

Omega-3s such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and structural fats like linoleic acid contribute to neuronal membrane fluidity, neurogenesis and neuroplasticity (Crupi, Marino, and Cuzzocrea 2013). Phospholipid methylation (PLM), a process enhanced by dopamine D4 receptor activity, a key gene implicated in ADHD (Martel et al. 2011), alters the structure of membranes, facilitating faster neuronal recovery while influencing ion channel behavior in the generation of gamma oscillations, brainwaves linked to attention and cognition. Abnormalities in membrane composition and PLM have been linked to impaired ion channel regulation and reduced gamma-band activity in ADHD (Cocchi et al. 2017) (Wilson et al. 2012). Phospholipid methylation, dependent on SAMe (see methylation Section 3.2), directly affects membrane fluidity and neurotransmitter receptor function. Maintaining optimal intake of phospholipid precursors, choline, methionine, and serine, may support PLM and cognitive performance (paper.txt, line 465).

### Specialized Pro-Resolving Mediators (SPMs)

Specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs), derived from omega-3s (DHA and EPA), play an active role in terminating inflammation without suppressing immune surveillance. These include resolvins, protectins, and maresins, which exert effects such as inhibition of neutrophil infiltration, downregulation of COX-2, and enhancement of macrophage-mediated clearance of cellular debris (Serhan and Petasis 2011). Moreover, SPMs modulate endothelial function through nitric oxide release and support neuroprotection by limiting glutamate-induced excitotoxicity and promoting regulatory T-cell differentiation (Briones et al. 2025). Although inflammation typically isolates tissues that have been injured or infected and begins the repair of an injury it is important to resolve and end the inflammatory response. SPMs are lipids that accomplish this without generalized immunosuppression (paper.txt, line 460).

In a controlled endotoxemia model (Ferguson et al. 2014), high-dose EPA+DHA (3.6 g/day) attenuated fever and downstream cytokines (IL-6, IL-10), even though TNF-α remained unchanged, suggesting that omega-3s reshape the resolution phase of acute inflammation rather than block its initiation. The endotoxemia model is discussed as an analogue of postprandial inflammation, which is highly relevant as we detail below ADHD is associated with metabolic disorders, and specifically linked to postprandial inflammation (Brown et al. 2025) (paper.txt, line 462).

### Phospholipid Transport and Blood-Brain Barrier

DHA or EPA incorporated into PC and converted into lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) crosses the blood-brain barrier (BBB) far more efficiently than its free fatty acid or triglyceride-bound forms (Patrick 2019). Studies show phospholipid-bound omega-3s such as krill oil and fish roe, provide EPA/DHA in a phospholipid form that gets easily converted to LPC was 1.9-fold more efficacious for brain gray matter DHA accretion in porcine models (Liu et al. 2014) (L. Liu et al. 2014). Krill oil is also a favored food source of DHA and EPA and since it is low in the food chain, does not concentrate environmental toxins or heavy metals and typically carries a lower heavy-metal burden than oils from higher-trophic fish (Colletti et al. 2021) (Patted et al. 2024) (paper.txt, line 454).

### APOE4 Genetic Considerations

Non-APOE4 carrying individuals three times greater DHA uptake into the brain than APOE4 carriers (Arellanes et al. 2020) highlighting the importance of considering genetic variability in omega-3 intervention trials. This may help explain inconsistent or modest results in Alzheimer's studies using DHA, where up to 40% of participants carry the APOE4 allele (paper.txt, line 456).

### EPA vs DHA Ratios

Most research showing brain function improvements lean towards higher ratio of EPA to DHA (e.g., 2:1 ratio or higher though Stonehouse et al used a DHA dominant dose) with DHA having a more structural role in the brain and EPA with a more functional role (McNamara and Carlson 2006) (Pei-Chen Chang 2021) (Stonehouse et al. 2013) (paper.txt, line 450).

### Omega-3 to Omega-6 Balance

While arachidonic acid (AA), an omega-6 PUFA, gives rise to mostly pro-inflammatory eicosanoids, omega-3s like eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and DHA are precursors to anti-inflammatory SPMs such as resolvins, marensins and protectins. Western diets can skew this ratio as high as 20:1 in favor of omega-6s, contributing to chronic inflammation and neurotransmitter dysregulation (Simopoulos 2011) while also increasing blood viscosity, vasospasm, and vasoconstriction which may play a major role in inducing autoimmune, cardiovascular and neurological diseases (Simopoulos 2009) (paper.txt, line 448).

### Endocannabinoid System Support

Supporting NAPEs production through diet via PE-rich foods like eggs, fish roe, and liver may enhance ECS tone. Clinical trials have shown a doubling of plasma levels after dietary increases in oat bran due to it's rich PE content (Sean Davies 2018). Polyphenols such as genistein may further enhance ECS tone by inhibiting fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), the enzyme responsible for AEA degradation (Gibellini and Smith 2010) (paper.txt, line 468).

## Dietary Recommendations

While the BRAIN Diet should encourage regular consumption of oily fish to meet baseline omega-3 requirements (~250–500 mg/day EPA+DHA), in line with EFSA guidelines. Beyond this, targeted foods such as salmon or lumpfish roe can be used to reliably and safely exceed minimum intakes, helping individuals achieve optimal omega-3 status for brain health, cognitive performance, and inflammatory regulation. This precision approach mirrors therapeutic ranges observed in neurocognitive research, without resorting to high-dose supplementation (paper.txt, line 251).

**BRAIN Diet Targets:**

- Omega-3 (PUFA) — ~1–2% and 250–500 mg EPA+DHA/day (RCT variations: 500–2000 mg/day) (paper.txt, line 408)

## Preparation and Storage

- **Phospholipid-bound forms** (fish roe, krill oil) enhance brain DHA accretion via LPC transport
- **Take with fat** for optimal absorption
- **Prioritize products with oxidation testing** - omega-3s are prone to oxidation
- **Balance EPA (inflammation) and DHA (membranes/neurodevelopment)**
- **Light/gentle cooking** preserves omega-3 content (especially important for fish like tuna which also contain creatine)

## Cofactors and Synergies

### B Vitamins

A large meta analysis shows that folic acid supplementation (0.5-5 mg/day) typically reduces plasma homocysteine by ~25% (from ~12 µmol/L to ~8-9 µmol/L. In those studies, adding B12 gave an additional ~7% reduction over folate alone (Collaboration 1998). However while folate (vitamin B9) is normally considered to be the primary nutrient for homocysteine reduction, long chain ω-3 fatty acids and vitamin B12 also contribute meaningfully and in combination more effectively. For example one study with 3 groups taking supplementations of 1: vitamin B-12, 2: fish oil, and 3: vitamin B-12+fish oil, lowered plasma Hcy concentrations by 22%, 19%, and 39%, respectively (Tao Huang et al. 2015). A reanalysis of the VITACOG trial data further demonstrated that B vitamin supplementation slowed cognitive decline only in participants with adequate omega-3 status (Oulhaj et al. 2016) (Oulhaj et al. 2016) (paper.txt, line 480).

### Choline and Phosphatidylcholine

Vegans should ensure adequate choline intake (e.g., soy or sunflower lecithin, soy foods, quinoa, broccoli) to support phosphatidylcholine synthesis and downstream LPC-DHA transport for brain delivery (paper.txt, line 259).
