## Overview

Omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA support neuronal membrane fluidity, neurotransmission, mitochondrial integrity, and active resolution of inflammation via specialized pro‑resolving mediators (SPMs). They modulate nuclear receptors (PPARs), ion channels, and synaptic plasticity and interact with B‑vitamins and methylation pathways.

## From the paper

- Lipids constitute 50–60% of brain dry weight; DHA ~14% of brain PUFA varies by region. Omega‑3s influence gene expression, neurotransmission, inflammation resolution, and synaptic plasticity. Phospholipid‑bound omega‑3s (e.g., krill oil, fish roe) enhance brain DHA accretion via LPC transport; APOE4 carriers show reduced brain DHA uptake. SPMs (resolvins, protectins, maresins) terminate inflammation without immunosuppression and improve endothelial function.

## Practical notes

- Sources: oily fish; algal oil (vegan). Consider phospholipid‑bound forms for brain delivery. Take with fat; prioritize products with oxidation testing. Balance EPA (inflammation) and DHA (membranes/neurodevelopment).
