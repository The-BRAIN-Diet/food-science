## Overview

Vitamin A and provitamin A carotenoids support neurodevelopment and immune modulation. Carotenoids, particularly β-carotene, also act as antioxidants in neural tissue, contributing to the antioxidant network. As both an antioxidant and vitamin A precursor, β-carotene supports immune regulation and neuronal development. Carotenoid absorption is enhanced with dietary fat and proper preparation, with co-consuming a small amount of unsaturated fat improving micelle formation and chylomicron packaging, increasing carotenoid and fat-soluble vitamin absorption.
