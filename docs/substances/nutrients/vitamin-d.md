mechanisms:
  Hormonal Response: Modulates neurotrophic factors vital for survival and growth of neurons; supports calcium homeostasis and calcium handling
  Stress Response: Modulates immune responses to reduce inflammation in the brain; supports stress response through neurotrophic and immune effects
  Gut Microbiome: Supports gut barrier integrity; nutrient deficiencies including vitamin D disrupt tight junctions, increasing permeability

- Vitamin D is crucial for brain development and cognitive function; it regulates neurotrophic factors vital for survival and growth of neurons and modulates immune responses to reduce inflammation in the brain
- Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent, particularly important for those consuming vegetarian and vegan diets, where there is a low intake of animal-based vitamin D
- Epithelial layer (tight junctions) disrupted by nutrient deficiencies including vitamin D, increasing permeability ("leaky gut")
- Supplementation with vitamin D has shown to significantly reduce behavioral problems and be effective [Hemamy et al. 2020](/docs/papers/BRAIN-Diet-References#hemamy_effect_2020)
- Vitamin D, along with magnesium, taurine, phospholipids, and flavonoids, supports calcium modulation, insulin sensitivity, sympathetic arousal, and mitochondrial excitability
- UV-exposed mushrooms can provide vitamin D2; one study looked at modeling in dietary guidelines with a view to expediting the global acceptance of UV-exposed mushrooms as a source of vitamin D [Starck et al. 2024](/docs/papers/BRAIN-Diet-References#starck_mushrooms_2024)
- Vegan diets can lack vitamin B12, vitamin D, DHA, and certain minerals, all of which are critical for brain health [Katonova et al. 2022](/docs/papers/BRAIN-Diet-References#katonova_effect_2022)
