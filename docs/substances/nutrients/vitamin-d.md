## Overview

Vitamin D modulates neurotrophins, immune signaling, and calcium balance; deficiency is common and relevant to cognition and mood.

## Biological Roles

### Brain Development and Cognitive Function

Vitamin D: Vitamin D is crucial for brain development and cognitive function. It regulates neurotrophic factors, which are vital for the survival and growth of neurons, and modulates immune responses to reduce inflammation in the brain. It is highly prevalent for populations to have high levels of vitamin D deficiency and this is particularly important for those consuming vegetarian and vegan diets, where there is a low intake of animal-based vitamin D (paper.txt, line 724).

### Neurotrophic Factors

Vitamin D regulates **neurotrophic factors**, which are vital for the survival and growth of neurons (paper.txt, line 724).

### Immune Modulation

Vitamin D modulates **immune responses to reduce inflammation in the brain** (paper.txt, line 724).

### Gut Barrier Integrity

Epithelial layer (tight junctions) – disrupted by nutrient deficiencies (zinc, **vitamin D**), alcohol, NSAIDs, and chronic stress, increasing permeability ("leaky gut") (paper.txt, line 509).

### Synergy with Magnesium

Supplementation with other compounds such as **vitamin D** have shown to significantly reduce behavioural problems be effective (Hemamy et al. 2020) (paper.txt, line 718).

### Calcium Modulation

Calcium Modulation: **Vitamin D**, magnesium, taurine, phospholipids (phosphatidylserine), flavonoids (quercetin) - Insulin sensitivity, sympathetic arousal, mitochondrial excitability (paper.txt, line 797).

## Food Sources

### Animal Sources

**Fatty Fish:**

- [Mackerel](../../foods/mackerel.md) - Omega-3, CoQ10, taurine, **vitamin D** (103–105 IU/100g)
- [Salmon](../../foods/salmon.md) - Omega-3, protein, B vitamins, **vitamin D**
- [Sardines](../../foods/sardines.md) - Omega-3, CoQ10, calcium, **vitamin D**
- [Tuna](../../foods/tuna.md) - Omega-3, niacin, selenium, creatine, **vitamin D**

**Eggs & Dairy:**

- [Eggs](../../foods/eggs.md) - Complete protein, choline, B6, **vitamin D** (in yolks)
- [Milk](../../foods/milk.md) - Complete protein, nicotinamide riboside, **vitamin D** (often fortified)
- [Yogurt](../../foods/yogurt.md) - Probiotics, protein, **vitamin D** (often fortified)
- [Cheese](../../foods/cheese.md) - Calcium, protein, **vitamin D**

### Plant Sources (Limited - Fortified or UV-Exposed)

**UV-Exposed Mushrooms:**

- [Mushrooms](../../foods/mushrooms.md) (UV-exposed) - **Vitamin D** source when exposed to UV light. One study looked at the modelling in dietary guidelines with a view to expediting the global acceptance of UV-exposed mushrooms as a source of vitamin D (Starck et al. 2024) (paper.txt, line 724).

**Fortified Sources:**

- [Mushrooms](../../foods/mushrooms.md) (UV-exposed) - **Vitamin D** source when exposed to UV light. One study looked at the modelling in dietary guidelines with a view to expediting the global acceptance of UV-exposed mushrooms as a source of vitamin D (Starck et al. 2024) (paper.txt, line 724).

**Fortified Sources:**

- [Fortified Plant Milks](../../foods/fortified-plant-milks.md) - **Vitamin D** fortified (D2 or D3)
- [Fortified Yogurts](../../foods/yogurt.md) - May be fortified with **vitamin D**

## Deficiency and Dietary Patterns

It is highly prevalent for populations to have high levels of **vitamin D deficiency** and this is particularly important for those consuming vegetarian and vegan diets, where there is a low intake of animal-based vitamin D (paper.txt, line 724).

(Katonova et al. 2022) note that while vegan diets are low in saturated fats and cholesterol and rich in antioxidants and fibre, they can lack vitamin B12, **vitamin D**, DHA, and certain minerals, all of which are critical for brain health (paper.txt, line 273).

## Dietary Recommendations

Targets foods providing essential brain supporting vitamins: **D (UV-exposed mushrooms; fortified plant milks/yogurts)**, B12 (fortified plant milks, nutritional yeast), and B6(chickpeas, potatoes, bananas, whole grains, soy). When dietary targets aren't met on a given day, fortified foods or supplements can help maintain coverage (paper.txt, line 752).

## Practical Notes

- **Animal sources** (fatty fish, eggs, dairy) provide vitamin D3
- **UV-exposed mushrooms** can provide vitamin D2
- **Fortified plant milks** and yogurts can help close vegan gaps
- **Pair with magnesium** for enhanced benefits
- **Deficiency is common**, especially in vegetarian/vegan diets
- **Sun exposure** is primary source for most people
- **Fat-soluble** - pair with dietary fat for optimal absorption
