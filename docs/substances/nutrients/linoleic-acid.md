## Overview

Linoleic acid (LA) is an essential omega-6 fatty acid that serves as a precursor to arachidonic acid and eicosanoids. Excessive n-6:n-3 ratios may skew toward pro-inflammatory eicosanoids, affecting inflammatory tone. The BRAIN Diet emphasizes balance between omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids, with overall dietary n-6:n-3 balance affecting inflammatory tone and brain health.
