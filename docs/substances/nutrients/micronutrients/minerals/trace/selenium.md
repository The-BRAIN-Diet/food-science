## Overview

Selenium is an essential trace mineral that functions as a critical cofactor for glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and other antioxidant enzymes. These selenium-dependent enzymes protect cell membranes and mitochondria from oxidative damage by neutralizing harmful reactive oxygen species. Selenium works within the broader antioxidant network, supporting redox balance and protecting against oxidative stress that can impair brain function. Adequate selenium intake is important for maintaining antioxidant defenses, particularly in tissues with high metabolic activity like the brain.
