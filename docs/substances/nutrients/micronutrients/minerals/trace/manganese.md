## Overview

Manganese is an essential trace mineral that plays a critical role in mitochondrial antioxidant defense. It serves as an essential cofactor for manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD or SOD2), an enzyme located in the mitochondrial matrix that detoxifies superoxide radicals, protecting mitochondria from oxidative damage. This makes manganese particularly important for maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production in energy-demanding tissues like the brain. Manganese balance is critical, as both deficiency and excess can negatively impact cognitive function.
