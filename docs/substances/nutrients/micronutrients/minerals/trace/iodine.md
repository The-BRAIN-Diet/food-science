## Overview

Iodine is an essential trace mineral that is critical for the synthesis of thyroid hormones (T3 and T4), which are crucial for brain development, maturation, and metabolic regulation throughout life. Thyroid hormones regulate the synthesis and activity of key neurotransmitters including dopamine and serotonin, making iodine essential for cognitive function, attention, and mood regulation. Iodine deficiency can significantly impact neurodevelopment and cognitive function, while excess intake can also cause thyroid dysfunction. Iodine is found in seafood, seaweed, and iodized salt, with seaweed content being highly variable by type and processing.

- Iodine is essential for thyroid hormones impacting neurodevelopment and neurotransmitter regulation; deficiency is common in low-seafood or non-fortified diets
- Listed as critical mineral with ADHD relevance; vegans/vegetarians need careful coverage depending on fortification practices
- Iodine content in seaweed is highly variable by type, season, and processing; risk of excess with some types (kelp can contain very high levels), making moderation important to avoid thyroid dysfunction
