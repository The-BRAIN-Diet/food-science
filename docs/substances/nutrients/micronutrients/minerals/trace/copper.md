## Overview

Copper is an essential trace mineral that functions as a cofactor in numerous redox enzymes and antioxidant systems. In the brain, copper is particularly important as a cofactor for dopamine β-hydroxylase, the enzyme that converts dopamine to norepinephrine, making it essential for catecholamine neurotransmitter synthesis. Copper participates in antioxidant enzyme networks and interacts closely with iron metabolism, with the balance between these two minerals being important for preventing oxidative stress. Copper also works with zinc in metallothionein proteins that help detoxify heavy metals.
