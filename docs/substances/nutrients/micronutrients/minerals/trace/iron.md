## Overview

Iron is an essential mineral that plays a central role in oxygen transport throughout the body via hemoglobin in red blood cells. In the brain, iron is critical for oxygen delivery and serves as an essential cofactor for tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in dopamine synthesis. This makes iron particularly important for catecholamine neurotransmitter production, which is relevant for attention, motivation, and executive function. Iron exists in two forms: heme iron from animal sources, which is more bioavailable, and non-heme iron from plant sources, which benefits from being paired with vitamin C to enhance absorption.

- Iron supplementation has not proven consistently effective in relieving ADHD symptoms; lower serum ferritin levels found in ADHD patients compared to controls
- Ferritin limits free iron that can produce oxidative radicals; lower levels in ADHD patients imply reduced iron regulation, resulting in more free iron and potentially increased oxidative stress
- Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) impairs absorption of vitamin B12, iron, and tryptophan, depriving the brain of essential neurotransmitter precursors
- Pairing plant-based iron sources with vitamin C (citrus) can enhance iron absorption (up to 4× increase) [Hallberg et al. 1989](/docs/papers/BRAIN-Diet-References#hallberg_role_1989)
- Polyphenol-rich beverages (tea/coffee) can reduce non-heme iron absorption if taken with iron-rich plant meals; spacing them ≥1 hour away or adding vitamin-C sources favors iron uptake
- Phytates can bind essential minerals such as zinc, iron, and calcium, potentially impairing their absorption; soaking and sprouting can reduce phytates and improve bioavailability [Taylor et al. 2009](/docs/papers/BRAIN-Diet-References#taylor_phytate_2009)
- Soaking and sprouting reduces phytates in legumes/grains, improving non-heme iron and zinc bioavailability [GREINER and KONIETZNY 1999](/docs/papers/BRAIN-Diet-References#greiner_phytate_1999)
