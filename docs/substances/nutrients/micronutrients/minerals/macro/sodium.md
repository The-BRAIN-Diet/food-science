## Overview

Sodium is an essential mineral and electrolyte that plays a critical role in maintaining fluid balance, nerve impulse transmission, and muscle function. In the nervous system, sodium ions are essential for generating action potentials, the electrical signals that allow neurons to communicate. Sodium works in balance with potassium to regulate cellular function, with the ratio between these two electrolytes being important for blood pressure regulation and neuronal excitability. While sodium is essential, the BRAIN Diet emphasizes whole foods and minimal processing, which naturally helps control sodium intake by reducing reliance on heavily processed foods.
