## Overview

Potassium is an essential mineral and electrolyte that plays a fundamental role in maintaining cellular function and nerve transmission. It is critical for establishing and maintaining membrane potential in neurons, which is essential for nerve signaling and neuronal excitability. Potassium works in balance with sodium to regulate fluid balance, blood pressure, and cardiovascular function. Adequate potassium intake from whole foods like fruits, vegetables, and legumes helps balance the effects of sodium and supports optimal nerve and muscle function.
