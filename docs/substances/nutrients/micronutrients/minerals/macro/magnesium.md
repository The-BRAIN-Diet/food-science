mechanisms:
  Neurochemical Balance: Broad cofactor for neurotransmitter synthesis and receptor modulation (e.g., NMDA, GABA); functions as an NMDA receptor antagonist and GABA receptor modulator; assists enzymes involved in synthesis of dopamine and serotonin
  Mitochondrial Support: Supports enzymes involved in glycolysis and the Krebs cycle (processes that generate ATP from glucose); binds to ATP and all triphosphates in cells to activate them
  Hormonal Response: Supports calcium modulation along with vitamin D, taurine, phospholipids, and flavonoids; supports insulin sensitivity, sympathetic arousal, and mitochondrial excitability
  Insulin Response: Supports insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism; magnesium deficiency is associated with insulin resistance; supports enzymes involved in glucose metabolism
  Stress Response: Helps manage stress responses; combined with vitamin D reduced behavioral problems; synergy with zinc and omega-3s reported

## Overview

Magnesium is an essential mineral that serves as a cofactor in over 300 enzymatic reactions throughout the body. It plays a crucial role in neurotransmitter synthesis and receptor modulation, functioning as an NMDA receptor antagonist and GABA receptor modulator, which helps balance excitatory and inhibitory signaling in the brain. Magnesium is also essential for ATP production, as it binds to ATP to activate it, and supports enzymes involved in glycolysis and the Krebs cycle. Additionally, magnesium works with other nutrients to support calcium modulation, insulin sensitivity, and stress response regulation. Deficiency is common and can exacerbate symptoms related to attention, mood, and sleep.
