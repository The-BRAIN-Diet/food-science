## Overview

Calcium is the most abundant mineral in the human body, with the majority stored in bones and teeth. Beyond its structural role, calcium is essential for numerous physiological processes including nerve impulse transmission, muscle contraction, and blood clotting. In the brain, calcium plays a critical role in neurotransmission, acting as a second messenger in neuronal signaling. Calcium absorption and utilization depend on adequate levels of vitamin D and vitamin K2, which work together to ensure proper calcium distribution to bones rather than soft tissues. The balance of calcium with other minerals like magnesium is important for optimal function.

## References

- Calcium supports skeletal integrity and neurotransmission; absorption and distribution depend on vitamin D and K2 status
- Calcium Modulation: Vitamin D, magnesium, taurine, phospholipids (phosphatidylserine), flavonoids (quercetin) support insulin sensitivity, sympathetic arousal, and mitochondrial excitability
- Phytates can bind essential minerals such as calcium, potentially impairing their absorption; fermentation can reduce phytate content and improve bioavailability
- Fortified plant milks and dairy milk can help meet calcium targets when used judiciously
