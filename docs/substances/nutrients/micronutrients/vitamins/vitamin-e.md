## Overview

Vitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin that functions as a lipid-phase antioxidant, protecting polyunsaturated fatty acids in cell membranes from peroxidation. This is particularly important for protecting DHA and other omega-3 fatty acids in neuronal membranes. Vitamin E works within antioxidant networks alongside vitamin C, CoQ10, and polyphenols, with these compounds regenerating each other to maintain antioxidant capacity. The BRAIN Diet emphasizes food-based sources rich in balanced antioxidants rather than high-dose single-nutrient supplementation, highlighting the synergy found in whole foods.
