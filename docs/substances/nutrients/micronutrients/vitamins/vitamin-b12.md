mechanisms:
  Methylation: Essential cofactor in remethylation of homocysteine to methionine, which is converted to S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe); works with B6, B2, and folate; contributes meaningfully to homocysteine reduction, especially in combination with omega-3 fatty acids
  Neurochemical Balance: Supports neurotransmitter production through methylation; essential for myelin synthesis
  Mitochondrial Support: Crucial role in conversion of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA, a key step in mitochondrial energy production; deficiency leads to buildup of methylmalonic acid and odd-chain fatty acids, which are neurotoxic

## Overview

Vitamin B12, also known as cobalamin, is a water-soluble vitamin that plays multiple critical roles in brain health. It is an essential cofactor in the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine, working with B6, B2, and folate in methylation processes that support neurotransmitter synthesis. B12 is crucial for myelin synthesis and maintenance, and plays a vital role in mitochondrial energy production through the conversion of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA. B12 deficiency can lead to buildup of methylmalonic acid and odd-chain fatty acids, which are neurotoxic. B12 is commonly deficient in vegetarians and vegans, as it is primarily found in animal products, though chlorella contains bioavailable B12.

- Vegetarians in their 80s had higher odds of cognitive impairment compared to omnivores, likely due to deficiencies in B12, EPA/DHA, and zinc [Jigeer et al. 2025](/docs/papers/BRAIN-Diet-References#jigeer_vegetarian_2025)
