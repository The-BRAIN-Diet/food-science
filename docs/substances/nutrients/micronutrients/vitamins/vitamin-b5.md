mechanisms:
  Mitochondrial Support: Forms CoA (coenzyme A), required for β-oxidation and TCA cycle acetyl-CoA flux; deficiency impairs ATP production impacting brain energy
  Hormonal Response: Essential for CoA/PDH function; supports hormonal synthesis pathways
  Stress Response: Supports stress response through energy metabolism and ATP production

## Overview

Vitamin B5, also known as pantothenic acid, is a water-soluble vitamin that is essential for the synthesis of coenzyme A (CoA). CoA is required for numerous metabolic processes including β-oxidation of fatty acids and TCA cycle acetyl-CoA flux, both of which are critical for ATP production. CoA is also essential for pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) function, linking glycolysis to the TCA cycle. Pantothenic acid deficiency impairs fatty acid oxidation and ATP production, potentially affecting brain energy levels and overall metabolic function.
