mechanisms:
  Hormonal Response: Modulates neurotrophic factors vital for survival and growth of neurons; supports calcium homeostasis and calcium handling
  Stress Response: Modulates immune responses to reduce inflammation in the brain; supports stress response through neurotrophic and immune effects
  Gut Microbiome: Supports gut barrier integrity; nutrient deficiencies including vitamin D disrupt tight junctions, increasing permeability

## Overview

Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that functions as a hormone in the body, playing crucial roles in brain development and cognitive function. It regulates neurotrophic factors that are vital for the survival and growth of neurons, and modulates immune responses to reduce inflammation in the brain. Vitamin D is essential for calcium homeostasis and works with other nutrients including magnesium, taurine, and phospholipids to support calcium modulation, insulin sensitivity, and mitochondrial function. Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent, particularly in those consuming vegetarian and vegan diets with low intake of animal-based sources, and it can disrupt gut barrier integrity by affecting tight junction function.
