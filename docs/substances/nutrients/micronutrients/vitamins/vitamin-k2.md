## Overview

Vitamin K2 is a fat-soluble vitamin that plays an important role in calcium metabolism and distribution. It works with vitamin D to ensure calcium is properly directed to bones rather than accumulating in soft tissues like blood vessels. Vitamin K2 occurs in fermented foods like natto and certain animal products, particularly in grass-fed dairy. It may support neural function through its role in calcium handling and is often found alongside other fat-soluble vitamins in nutrient-dense foods like hard cheeses and grass-fed butter.
