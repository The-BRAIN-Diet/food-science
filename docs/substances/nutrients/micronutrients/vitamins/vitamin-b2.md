## Overview

Vitamin B2, also known as riboflavin, is a water-soluble vitamin that forms the coenzymes FMN (flavin mononucleotide) and FAD (flavin adenine dinucleotide). These coenzymes support oxidative metabolism and redox balance throughout the body. FAD acts as a critical cofactor for MTHFR (methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase), linking riboflavin to homocysteine recycling and methylation capacity. Riboflavin also facilitates the metabolism of other B vitamins including B12, B6, and niacin, and supports antioxidant enzymes, making it an important component of the B vitamin network.
