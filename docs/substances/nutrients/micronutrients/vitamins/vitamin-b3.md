## Overview

Vitamin B3, also known as niacin or niacinamide, is a water-soluble vitamin that serves as a precursor to NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide), a central coenzyme in cellular energy metabolism. NAD+ is essential for oxidative phosphorylation, acting as an electron carrier that enables ATP generation in mitochondria. Niacin also supports sirtuin signaling and mitochondrial biogenesis, making it key for neuronal energy metabolism. Adequate niacin intake helps maintain NAD+ levels, which naturally decline with age and can be depleted under conditions of high energy demand or stress.
