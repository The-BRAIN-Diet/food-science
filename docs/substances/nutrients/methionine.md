## References

- Methionine is essential and forms SAMe, the universal methyl donor for neurotransmitter synthesis and membrane phospholipid methylation
- B vitamins, particularly B6, B2, folate (5-MTHF), and B12, are essential cofactors in remethylation of homocysteine to methionine, which is converted to SAMe
