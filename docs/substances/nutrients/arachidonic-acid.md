## Overview

Arachidonic acid (AA) is an omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid that gives rise to eicosanoids with predominantly pro-inflammatory actions. The overall dietary n-6:n-3 balance affects inflammatory tone, and the BRAIN Diet emphasizes maintaining an appropriate balance between omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids to support brain health and reduce excessive inflammatory signaling.
