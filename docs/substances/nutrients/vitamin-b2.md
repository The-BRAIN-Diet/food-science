## Overview

Riboflavin forms FMN/FAD, supporting oxidative metabolism and redox balance; FAD is a critical cofactor for MTHFR, linking B2 to homocysteine recycling and methylation.

## From the paper

- Riboflavin facilitates metabolism of B12, B6, and niacin; supports antioxidant enzymes; ties into methylation capacity.
