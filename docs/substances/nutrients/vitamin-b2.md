## Overview

Riboflavin (vitamin B2) is a precursor to the key coenzymes FMN (flavin mononucleotide) and FAD (flavin adenine dinucleotide), supporting oxidative metabolism and redox balance. FAD acts as a critical cofactor for MTHFR (methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase), linking riboflavin to homocysteine recycling and methylation capacity. Riboflavin coenzymes facilitate the metabolism of B12, vitamin B6, and niacin, and support antioxidant enzymes. This ties riboflavin into methylation capacity and the broader B-vitamin network essential for neurotransmitter synthesis and homocysteine regulation.
