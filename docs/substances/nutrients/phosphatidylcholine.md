## Overview

Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is a major neuronal membrane phospholipid central to membrane fluidity, receptor function, methylation-linked phospholipid remodeling, and acetylcholine synthesis. DHA/EPA incorporated into PC are converted to lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), a key transport form across the BBB.

## From the paper

- “DHA or EPA incorporated into PC and converted into lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) crosses the blood–brain barrier far more efficiently than free fatty acid or triglyceride forms… phospholipid‑bound omega‑3s (krill oil, fish roe) were ~1.9× more efficacious for gray matter DHA in porcine models.”

## Practical notes

- Food sources supporting PC: eggs, fish roe, liver; choline intake supports PC synthesis. Consider phospholipid‑bound omega‑3s when brain delivery is a priority.
