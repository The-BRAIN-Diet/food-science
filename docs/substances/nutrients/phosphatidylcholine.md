## Overview

Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is a major neuronal membrane phospholipid central to membrane fluidity, receptor function, methylation-linked phospholipid remodeling, and acetylcholine synthesis. DHA or EPA incorporated into PC and converted into lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) crosses the blood-brain barrier far more efficiently than free fatty acid or triglyceride-bound forms. Phospholipid-bound omega-3s (krill oil, fish roe) were approximately 1.9× more efficacious for gray matter DHA in porcine models. Food sources supporting PC include eggs, fish roe, and liver, and choline intake supports PC synthesis.
