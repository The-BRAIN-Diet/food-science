mechanisms:
  Neurochemical Balance: Major neuronal membrane phospholipid central to membrane fluidity, receptor function, and acetylcholine synthesis; DHA/EPA incorporated into PC are converted to lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), a key transport form across the BBB

- DHA or EPA incorporated into PC and converted into lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) crosses the blood-brain barrier far more efficiently than free fatty acid or triglyceride-bound forms [Patrick 2019](/docs/papers/BRAIN-Diet-References#patrick_role_2019)
- Phospholipid-bound omega-3s (krill oil, fish roe) were approximately 1.9× more efficacious for gray matter DHA in porcine models [Liu et al. 2014](/docs/papers/BRAIN-Diet-References#liu_higher_2014)
- Food sources supporting PC: eggs, fish roe, liver; choline intake supports PC synthesis
