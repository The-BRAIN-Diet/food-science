## Overview

Tyrosine is a catecholamine precursor (dopamine, norepinephrine); brain transport via LAT1 competes with other LNAAs; iron/B6/folate/BH4 are cofactors.

## From the paper

- Morning protein supports motivation/focus; benefits are context‑dependent; cofactors and inflammation modulate pathway efficacy.
