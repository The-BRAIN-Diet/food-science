## Overview

Vitamin K2 modulates calcium distribution and may support neural function. It occurs in fermented foods and certain animal products, often co-occurring with other fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E) within nutrient-dense food matrices. Vitamin K2 is discussed alongside fat-soluble nutrients within food-matrix guidance, with sources including cheeses, egg yolks, and fermented foods. The BRAIN Diet emphasizes obtaining vitamin K2 through whole-food sources that provide synergistic fat-soluble nutrients rather than isolated supplementation.
