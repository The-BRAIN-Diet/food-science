## Overview

Phenylalanine is an essential amino acid that converts to tyrosine and supports catecholamine synthesis, including dopamine and norepinephrine. It participates in LAT1 (large neutral amino acid transporter) competition at the blood-brain barrier, where moderate carbohydrate intake reduces competition at the LAT1 transporter. Both dopamine and norepinephrine synthesis pathways rely on cofactors including iron, B6, folate, omega-3s, and BH₄ (tetrahydrobiopterin) to support rate-limiting steps in catecholamine synthesis.
