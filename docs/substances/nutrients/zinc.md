description: Cofactor in neurotransmission and antioxidant enzymes; dopamine modulation

## Overview

Zinc supports neurotransmitter pathways (especially dopaminergic modulation), antioxidant enzymes, and immune signaling; insufficiency is linked with cognitive and mood symptoms.

## From the paper

- “Zinc is important for neurotransmitter regulation, particularly dopamine; higher doses (e.g., 30 mg) increased BDNF; spreading doses improved absorption.”

## Practical notes

- Sources: oysters, beef, legumes, nuts/seeds. Phytates reduce absorption—use soaking/sprouting; pair with animal proteins when appropriate.
