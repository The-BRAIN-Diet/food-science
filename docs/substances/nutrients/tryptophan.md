## Overview

Tryptophan is a precursor for serotonin and melatonin and can feed NAD+ synthesis via the kynurenine pathway; brain entry competes at LAT1 with other LNAAs.

## From the paper

- Carb pairing raises Trp:LNAA ratio; timing influences calm/sleep physiology; effects on ADHD symptoms are limited; still relevant to mood/sleep.
