## Overview

Tryptophan is a precursor for serotonin and melatonin and can feed NAD+ synthesis via the kynurenine pathway; brain entry competes at LAT1 with other LNAAs.

## Biological Roles

### Serotonin Synthesis

**Serotonin:** Mood regulation, emotional control, impulse moderation. Cofactors: **Tryptophan**; B6, magnesium; carb co-ingestion to aid LAT1 transport. Food sources: Turkey, eggs, dairy, soy, seeds, oats, bananas. Pair tryptophan-rich proteins with moderate carbs to increase Trp:LNAA ratio; timing midday or evening for calming effect (paper.txt, line 348).

Tryptophan, a serotonin precursor, has been linked to reduced anxiety, improved mood, and lower depressive symptoms (Aquili, 2020a), but shows very limited benefit for ADHD symptoms (Dinu et al., 2023) (paper.txt, line 364).

### LAT1 Transport and Competition

Its entry into the brain occurs via the LAT1 transporter and competes with other large neutral amino acids (LNAAs) (tyrosine, phenylalanine, leucine, isoleucine, valine) (paper.txt, line 364).

Carbohydrate-rich, low-protein meals raise the plasma **tryptophan:LNAA ratio**, because insulin pushes the competing LNAAs out to muscles, lowering competing LNAAs in plasma, thereby reducing competition at the BBB. In a crossover breakfast study (Wurtman et al. 2003) (Wurtman et al. 2003):

- Compared to the high protein breakfast, the high carbohydrate low protein breakfast raised the **tryptophan:LNAA ratio** by a median ~54% (range ~36–88%).
- Compared to the high carbohydrate breakfast, the high protein breakfast raised the tyrosine:LNAA ratio by a median ~28% (range ~10–64%) (paper.txt, lines 365-367).

Carbohydrate type also matters: sucrose produced a larger rise in **tryptophan:LNAA (+34%)** than starch (+20%), consistent with higher-GI carbohydrates more strongly enhancing brain tryptophan bioavailability (Lyons and Truswell 1988) (Lyons and Truswell 1988) (paper.txt, line 373).

### Melatonin Synthesis

**Tryptophan + complex carbohydrates:** Aid serotonin conversion to melatonin; examples include pumpkin seeds + oats (paper.txt, line 884).

Nutritional strategies that support sleep include evening meals rich in **tryptophan** and complex carbohydrates to promote melatonin synthesis, along with micronutrients such as magnesium and zinc known to improve sleep quality (Peuhkuri et al., 2012; Rondanelli et al., 2018) (paper.txt, line 881).

### NAD+ Synthesis

**Tryptophan:** Converted to NAD⁺ via kynurenine pathway. Food sources: Turkey, chicken, eggs, pumpkin seeds, oats, soybeans (paper.txt, line 707).

### Gut-Brain Axis

Gut health influences the production of neurotransmitters and their precursors, including serotonin, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and dopamine. While gut-derived neurotransmitters are unlikely to cross the blood–brain barrier (BBB), their precursors, such as **tryptophan** and tyrosine, do, enabling local synthesis in the brain (O'Mahony et al. 2015a) (paper.txt, line 502).

Enhancing dietary protein, prebiotics, and microbiome diversity promotes microbial metabolism and absorption of key amino acids, increasing **tryptophan** and tyrosine availability for central serotonin and dopamine synthesis. This pathway supports mood regulation and cognitive performance (Sinha et al. 2024) (O'Mahony et al. 2015b) (paper.txt, line 582).

Taken together, these strategies not only recalibrate the microbiome but may also directly influence pathways central to ADHD, restoring neurotransmitter precursors such as **tryptophan** (Sinha et al. 2024), dampening LPS-driven inflammation, and stabilizing gut–brain signaling networks that underpin attention, mood, and cognitive resilience (paper.txt, line 575).

### SIBO and Absorption

Similarly, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) impairs absorption of vitamin B12, iron, and **tryptophan**, depriving the brain of essential neurotransmitter precursors (paper.txt, line 511).

Overgrowth Suppression (SIBO, Candida, Pathobionts): Polyphenol antimicrobials (berberine, oregano, green tea); short-term low-FODMAP when needed; prokinetic foods (ginger); Green-MED + fermented food diet - ↓ SIBO recurrence, ↓ LPS translocation, ↑ nutrient absorption (B12, iron, **tryptophan**), ↑ SCFA resilience (paper.txt, line 573).

## Timing and Meal Composition

### Evening Timing for Sleep

**Evening (Wind-down, sleep prep):** ⬇️ Suppress for calm, ⬇️ Lower arousal, ⬆️ Strong GABA activation for sleep onset - **Tryptophan + complex carbs** (pumpkin seeds + oats), Magnesium, taurine, L-theanine, Herbal teas (e.g. chamomile for apigenin, lemon balm, tart cherry juice) (paper.txt, line 853).

Reserving **tryptophan** with complex carbohydrates for the evening should facilitate serotonin and melatonin synthesis, supporting sleep physiology (This approach is grounded in circadian neurochemistry and nutrition mechanisms, though direct human outcome data remain limited) (paper.txt, line 843).

### Carbohydrate Pairing Strategy

Pair **tryptophan-rich proteins** with moderate carbs to increase Trp:LNAA ratio; timing midday or evening for calming effect (paper.txt, line 348).

**Tryptophan + complex carbohydrates:** Aid serotonin conversion to melatonin; examples include pumpkin seeds + oats (paper.txt, line 884).

### Exercise Timing

Post-exercise windows offer heightened sensitivity to glucose and amino acids, making it an ideal time to deliver precursors like tyrosine (dopamine), **tryptophan** (serotonin), magnesium, and omega-3s to support recovery and cognitive resilience (paper.txt, line 861).

These post-exercise windows present an optimal time to deliver nutrients critical to neurotransmitter synthesis and brain recovery. For example, amino acids like tyrosine and **tryptophan**, essential for dopamine and serotonin production respectively, are more efficiently utilized after physical exertion (paper.txt, line 867).

## Practical Notes

- **Pair with complex carbohydrates** to increase Trp:LNAA ratio (insulin pushes competing LNAAs to muscles)
- **Evening timing** - Reserve tryptophan + complex carbs for evening to support melatonin synthesis
- **Higher-GI carbs** (sucrose) produce larger rises in tryptophan:LNAA than starch
- **Address SIBO** if present, as it impairs tryptophan absorption
- **Gut health** - Enhancing microbiome diversity increases tryptophan availability
- **Limited ADHD benefit** - Shows very limited benefit for ADHD symptoms but relevant to mood/sleep
