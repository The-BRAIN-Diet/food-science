## Overview

Valine is an essential branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) that complements leucine and isoleucine. It participates in LAT1 (large neutral amino acid transporter) competition dynamics relevant to tryptophan and tyrosine transport at the blood-brain barrier. Moderate carbohydrate intake reduces competition at the LAT1 transporter, allowing better transport of neurotransmitter precursors like tryptophan and tyrosine into the brain.
