## Overview

Manganese is essential for mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (SOD2), supporting detoxification of superoxide within the mitochondrial matrix. This enzyme is critical for protecting mitochondria from oxidative damage. Green tea contributes manganese along with small amounts of fluoride and potassium, alongside polyphenols that support antioxidant defenses. Dysregulation of manganese is linked to cognition-related outcomes, and balance is critical, as both deficiency and excess can be problematic.
