  Hormonal Response: Essential for synthesis of thyroid hormones (T3 and T4), which are crucial for brain development, maturation, and metabolic regulation
  Neurochemical Balance: Thyroid hormones regulate synthesis and regulation of key neurotransmitters (dopamine and serotonin), supporting cognitive function and development

## Overview

Iodine is an essential trace mineral that plays a critical role in thyroid hormone synthesis and brain development. Iodine is essential for thyroid hormones impacting neurodevelopment and neurotransmitter regulation, with deficiency common in low-seafood or non-fortified diets. Iodine is essential for the synthesis of thyroid hormones (T3 and T4), which are crucial for brain development, maturation, and the regulation of key neurotransmitters like dopamine and serotonin. Iodine is listed as a critical mineral with ADHD relevance, and vegans/vegetarians need careful coverage depending on fortification practices. Iodine content in seaweed is highly variable by type, season, and processing, with risk of excess in some types (kelp can contain very high levels), making moderation important to avoid thyroid dysfunction.
