## Overview

Threonine is an essential amino acid that supports protein synthesis and gut mucin production, indirectly supporting gut barrier integrity. Mucin production is important for maintaining the gut barrier's protective layer, and threonine is a key component in mucin synthesis. This supports the gut barrier's role in preventing lipopolysaccharide (LPS) translocation and maintaining gut-brain communication.
