mechanisms:
  Mitochondrial Support: Forms CoA (coenzyme A), required for β-oxidation and TCA cycle acetyl-CoA flux; deficiency impairs ATP production impacting brain energy
  Hormonal Response: Essential for CoA/PDH function; supports hormonal synthesis pathways
  Stress Response: Supports stress response through energy metabolism and ATP production

## Overview

Pantothenic acid (vitamin B5) forms CoA (coenzyme A), which is required for β-oxidation of fatty acids and TCA cycle acetyl-CoA flux. CoA is essential for pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) function, linking glycolysis to the TCA cycle. Deficiency impairs fatty-acid oxidation and ATP generation, directly impacting brain energy metabolism. As a critical coenzyme in energy production pathways, pantothenic acid supports mitochondrial function and overall cellular energy status, which is fundamental for neuronal function and stress resilience.
