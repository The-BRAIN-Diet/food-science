## Overview

Thiamine supports mitochondrial glucose metabolism (PDH, α-KGDH) and ATP synthesis in neurons; CNS pools are small and require continuous supply.

## From the paper

- Thiamine is essential for mitochondrial glucose metabolism and ATP; rapid turnover implies vulnerability to deficiency; therapeutic dosing studied in neurodegeneration.
