mechanisms:
  Mitochondrial Support: Essential for mitochondrial glucose metabolism in the brain leading to ATP production; supports PDH (pyruvate dehydrogenase) and α-KGDH (alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase) function
  Insulin Response: Supports glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity through mitochondrial function

- Thiamine is essential for mitochondrial glucose metabolism in the brain leading to ATP production [Dhir et al. 2019](/docs/papers/BRAIN-Diet-References#dhir_thiamine_2019)
- Thiamine does not exist in a large brain "reservoir"; the CNS maintains small, tightly regulated intracellular pools that depend on continuous, transporter-mediated supply, making deficiency states potentially acute
- Therapeutic doses up to 100× higher than RDA have shown benefit in Alzheimer's disease, with larger Phase 2 trials in progress
