## Overview

Thiamine (vitamin B1) is essential for mitochondrial glucose metabolism in the brain, leading to ATP production. It supports pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (α-KGDH) function, critical enzymes in the TCA cycle. Thiamine does not appear to exist in a large brain "reservoir"; instead, the CNS maintains small, tightly regulated intracellular pools that depend on continuous, transporter-mediated supply, making deficiency states potentially acute. While RDAs are low (~1.1–1.2 mg), therapeutic doses up to 100× higher have shown benefit in Alzheimer's disease, with larger Phase 2 trials in progress. Dietary sources include pork, sunflower seeds, salmon, peas, rice, and lentils.
