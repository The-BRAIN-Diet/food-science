mechanisms:
  Gut Microbiome: Supports gut barrier integrity through collagen and gelatin synthesis; helps seal gut lining and reduce permeability; affects inflammation and gut-brain communication
  Neurochemical Balance: Acts as an inhibitory neurotransmitter; improves sleep latency and quality; supports GABA pathways and neurotransmitter balance
  Stress Response: Improves sleep latency and quality; supports stress resilience through improved sleep regulation

## Overview

Glycine is a nonessential amino acid that serves multiple important functions in the body and brain. It acts as an inhibitory neurotransmitter, improving sleep latency and quality by supporting GABA pathways and neurotransmitter balance. Glycine is essential for the synthesis of collagen and gelatin, which support gut barrier integrity by helping seal the gut lining and reduce permeability. It is also required for glutathione synthesis, supporting antioxidant defense and detoxification. Slow-cooked bone-in meats and cartilage-rich cuts release glycine-rich collagen and gelatin into the broth.
