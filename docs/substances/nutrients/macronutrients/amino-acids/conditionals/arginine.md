mechanisms:
  Mitochondrial Support: Precursor for creatine synthesis (along with glycine and methionine); creatine supports ATP recycling via the phosphocreatine system in neurons; important for vegetarians who rely on endogenous creatine synthesis
  Neurochemical Balance: Precursor for nitric oxide (NO) synthesis; nitric oxide supports cerebral blood flow and vascular function

## Overview

Arginine is a conditionally essential amino acid that serves as a precursor for both creatine and nitric oxide synthesis. Along with glycine and methionine, arginine is one of the three amino acid precursors required for endogenous creatine synthesis, making it particularly important for vegetarians who rely on endogenous production rather than dietary creatine. Arginine is also converted to nitric oxide (NO), which supports cerebral blood flow and vascular function. Pea protein isolate is noted for its high arginine content, supporting nitric oxide production and cerebral blood flow.
