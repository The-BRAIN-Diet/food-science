## Overview

Tyrosine is a nonessential amino acid that serves as the precursor for the catecholamine neurotransmitters dopamine and norepinephrine, which are essential for attention, motivation, and executive function. Tyrosine's brain transport via LAT1 competes with other large neutral amino acids, and moderate carbohydrate intake can reduce this competition. The conversion of tyrosine to dopamine requires tyrosine hydroxylase, which depends on iron as an essential cofactor, along with B6, folate, omega-3s, and BH₄ (tetrahydrobiopterin) to support rate-limiting steps in catecholamine synthesis.
