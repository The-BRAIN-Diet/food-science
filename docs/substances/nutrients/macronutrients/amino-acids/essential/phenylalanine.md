## Overview

Phenylalanine is an essential amino acid that serves as a precursor to tyrosine, which in turn is converted to the catecholamine neurotransmitters dopamine and norepinephrine. Phenylalanine participates in LAT1 competition at the blood-brain barrier along with other large neutral amino acids, and its conversion to tyrosine requires the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. Both dopamine and norepinephrine synthesis pathways rely on cofactors including iron, B6, folate, omega-3s, and BH₄ (tetrahydrobiopterin) to support rate-limiting steps in catecholamine synthesis, making phenylalanine an important component of neurotransmitter production.
