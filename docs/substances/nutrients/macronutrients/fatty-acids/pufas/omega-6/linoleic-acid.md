## Overview

Linoleic acid (LA) is an essential omega-6 fatty acid that the body cannot synthesize and must obtain from the diet. It serves as a precursor to arachidonic acid and various eicosanoids, which are signaling molecules involved in inflammation and immune function. While linoleic acid is essential, the balance between omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids is important, as excessive n-6:n-3 ratios (common in Western diets) may skew toward pro-inflammatory eicosanoids. The BRAIN Diet emphasizes maintaining an appropriate balance between omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids for optimal inflammatory tone and brain health.
