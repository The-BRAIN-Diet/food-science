  Inflammation: Omega-6 PUFA that gives rise to eicosanoids with predominantly pro-inflammatory actions; overall dietary n-6:n-3 balance affects inflammatory tone
  Oxidative Stress: Contributes to inflammatory and oxidative stress pathways when in excess relative to omega-3s

## Overview

Arachidonic acid (AA) is an omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid that serves as a precursor to various eicosanoids, which are signaling molecules involved in inflammation and immune function. While arachidonic acid gives rise to predominantly pro-inflammatory eicosanoids, it is also important for normal brain development and function. The key is maintaining an appropriate balance between omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids, as excessive n-6:n-3 ratios (common in Western diets) can contribute to chronic inflammation and neurotransmitter dysregulation. The BRAIN Diet emphasizes maintaining an appropriate balance for optimal inflammatory tone.
