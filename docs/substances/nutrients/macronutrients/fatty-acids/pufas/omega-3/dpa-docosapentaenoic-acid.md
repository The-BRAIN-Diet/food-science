## Overview

DPA (docosapentaenoic acid, 22:5 n-3) is the "intermediate" omega-3 fatty acid between EPA and DHA in the metabolic pathway. It plays important roles in vascular health, repair, and immune modulation. While DPA has emerging brain-health roles, it has been less studied than EPA and DHA. DPA can be converted to DHA and serves as an intermediate in the omega-3 metabolic pathway.
