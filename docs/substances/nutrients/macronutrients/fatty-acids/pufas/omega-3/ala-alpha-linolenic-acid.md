## Overview

ALA (alpha-linolenic acid) is an essential omega-3 fatty acid that serves as a precursor to DHA and EPA. However, conversion to DHA/EPA in adults is limited, with conversion rates typically less than 5% in most adults. Food sources include flax seeds, chia seeds, and walnuts. While ALA is essential, direct DHA/EPA intake from fish, fish roe, or algal oil is strongly recommended for optimal brain health, as conversion from ALA is insufficient to meet brain-specific omega-3 requirements.
