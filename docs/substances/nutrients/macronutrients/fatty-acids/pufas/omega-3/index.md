mechanisms:
  Inflammation: "Specialized Pro-Resolving Mediators (SPMs) - resolvins, protectins, maresins terminate inflammation without immunosuppression, downregulate COX-2, inhibit neutrophil infiltration, enhance macrophage clearance, limit glutamate-induced excitotoxicity. Production of DHEA and EPEA (N-acyl ethanolamines) feeds into CB2-related anti-inflammatory signalling; ECS lipid mediators regulate immune tone and microglial activation (primary anchor for ECS mechanism: Inflammation & Oxidative Stress)."
  Neurochemical Balance: Membrane fluidity and neurotransmitter receptor function, ion channel behavior and gamma oscillations, support neurotransmission and phospholipid methylation
  Mitochondrial Support: "ECS-related lipid signalling may influence mitochondrial coupling/efficiency (context-dependent; largely preclinical). Omega-3 incorporation changes membrane fluidity (secondary anchor for ECS mechanism: Mitochondrial Function & Bioenergetics)."
  Endocannabinoid System: Production of docosahexaenoyl ethanolamide (DHEA) and eicosapentaenoyl ethanolamide (EPEA), N-acyl ethanolamines for endocannabinoid-like signaling
  Gut Microbiome: Support intestinal anti-inflammatory tone, barrier function, and microbiota composition; vagal and immune pathways link gut to brain
  Hormonal Response: Support hormonal balance through membrane integrity and anti-inflammatory effects
  Stress Response: Improve vagal tone and HRV control, improve cortisol rhythms
  Methylation: Support homocysteine reduction in combination with B12, phospholipid methylation (PLM) dependent on SAMe

## Omega-3 fatty acids (ALA, DHA, EPA, DPA)

<FolderList folder="substances/nutrients/macronutrients/fatty-acids/pufas/omega-3" />

## Overview

Omega-3 fatty acids, particularly EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid), are essential polyunsaturated fats that are central to the BRAIN Diet. DHA constitutes approximately 14% of brain polyunsaturated fatty acids and is critical for membrane fluidity, neurotransmitter receptor function, and synaptic plasticity. Omega-3s produce specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) including resolvins, protectins, and maresins, which actively terminate inflammation without suppressing immune function. They also support the endocannabinoid system through production of N-acyl ethanolamines, improve vagal tone and heart rate variability, and work synergistically with B vitamins in methylation processes. Phospholipid-bound forms (from krill oil, fish roe) cross the blood-brain barrier more efficiently than triglyceride forms.
