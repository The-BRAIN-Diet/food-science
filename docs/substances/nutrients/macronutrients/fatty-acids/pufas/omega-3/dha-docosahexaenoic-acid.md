  Inflammation: Precursor to specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) including protectins and maresins; terminates inflammation without immunosuppression
  Neurochemical Balance: Accounts for ~10–15% of total brain fatty acids, but represents 20–30% of fatty acids in neuronal phospholipids such as PE and PS, and more than 90% of the brain's omega-3 PUFA; critical for membrane fluidity, synaptic vesicle fusion, and neurodevelopment; transported across BBB as LPC-DHA via MFSD2A
  Endocannabinoid System: Production of docosahexaenoyl ethanolamide (DHEA), an N-acyl ethanolamine for endocannabinoid-like signaling

## Overview

DHA (docosahexaenoic acid, 22:6 n-3) accounts for approximately 10–15% of total brain fatty acids, but it represents 20–30% of the fatty acids in neuronal phospholipids such as phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylserine (PS), and more than 90% of the brain's omega-3 PUFA. It is critical for membrane fluidity, synaptic vesicle fusion, and neurodevelopment. DHA is transported across the blood-brain barrier as LPC-DHA via the MFSD2A transporter, making phospholipid-bound forms (such as those found in fish roe and krill oil) particularly effective for brain DHA accretion.

- DHA accounts for ~10–15% of total brain fatty acids, but it represents 20–30% of the fatty acids in neuronal phospholipids such as PE and PS, and more than 90% of the brain's omega-3 PUFA; omega-3s influence gene expression, neurotransmission, inflammation resolution, and synaptic plasticity [McNamara and Carlson 2006](/docs/papers/BRAIN-Diet-References#mcnamara_role_2006)
- DHA or EPA incorporated into PC and converted into lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) crosses the blood-brain barrier far more efficiently than free fatty acid or triglyceride-bound forms [Patrick 2019](/docs/papers/BRAIN-Diet-References#patrick_role_2019)
- Phospholipid-bound omega-3s such as krill oil and fish roe were 1.9-fold more efficacious for brain gray matter DHA accretion in porcine models [Liu et al. 2014](/docs/papers/BRAIN-Diet-References#liu_higher_2014)
- Specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs), derived from omega-3s (DHA and EPA), terminate inflammation without suppressing immune surveillance; include resolvins, protectins, and maresins [Serhan and Petasis 2011](/docs/papers/BRAIN-Diet-References#serhan_resolvins_2011)
- Found in: salmon roe, fish oil, algae oil
