mechanisms:
  Inflammation: Potent anti-inflammatory; precursor to E-series resolvins; specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) terminate inflammation without immunosuppression, downregulate COX-2, inhibit neutrophil infiltration, enhance macrophage clearance
  Neurochemical Balance: Modulates dopamine and serotonin signalling; synergises with DHA but has independent mechanisms; membrane fluidity and neurotransmitter receptor function
  Endocannabinoid System: Production of eicosapentaenoyl ethanolamide (EPEA), an N-acyl ethanolamine for endocannabinoid-like signaling

## Overview

EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid, 20:5 n-3) is a potent anti-inflammatory omega-3 fatty acid that serves as a precursor to E-series resolvins. It modulates dopamine and serotonin signalling and synergises with DHA while having independent mechanisms. Most research showing brain function improvements leans towards higher ratios of EPA to DHA (e.g., 2:1 ratio), with DHA having a more structural role and EPA with a more functional role.
