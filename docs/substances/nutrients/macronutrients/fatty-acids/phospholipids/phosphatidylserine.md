## Overview

Phosphatidylserine (PS) is a neuronal membrane phospholipid that plays important roles in membrane dynamics and signaling. It supports calcium modulation along with vitamin D, magnesium, taurine, and flavonoids, contributing to insulin sensitivity, sympathetic arousal, and mitochondrial excitability. PS is used for cognition and stress modulation and fits within the phospholipid support family alongside PC and PE. It helps maintain proper neuronal membrane structure and function, supporting neurotransmitter signaling and overall brain health.
