## Overview

Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) is a key brain phospholipid that serves as a precursor to both phosphatidylcholine (PC) and N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamines (NAPEs). NAPEs are precursors to N-acyl ethanolamines (NAEs) including palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), oleoylethanolamide (OEA), and anandamide (AEA), which are bioactive lipids that act as neuromodulators with anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, and mood-regulating effects. PE is a potential ADHD biomarker and supporting NAPEs production through diet via PE-rich foods like eggs, fish roe, liver, and oat bran may enhance endocannabinoid system tone.
