mechanisms:
  Mitochondrial Support: MCTs are converted to ketones (beta-hydroxybutyrate) in the liver, which serve as an alternative energy substrate for mitochondria; ketones can be used by brain mitochondria when glucose metabolism is impaired, supporting ATP production and mitochondrial function
  Neurochemical Balance: Ketones produced from MCTs provide ATP through mitochondrial metabolism; ATP is essential for neurotransmitter synthesis, release, and reuptake, indirectly supporting neurochemical balance by ensuring adequate energy for neuronal function

## Overview

Medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) are composed of medium-chain fatty acids, primarily caprylic acid (C8) and capric acid (C10), found in coconut oil and MCT oil. MCTs are rapidly metabolized in the liver and converted to ketones (beta-hydroxybutyrate), which serve as an alternative energy substrate for mitochondria. Ketones can be used by brain mitochondria when glucose metabolism is impaired, supporting ATP production and mitochondrial function. This makes MCTs particularly valuable for providing rapid brain energy and supporting neuronal function, as ATP is essential for neurotransmitter synthesis, release, and reuptake.
