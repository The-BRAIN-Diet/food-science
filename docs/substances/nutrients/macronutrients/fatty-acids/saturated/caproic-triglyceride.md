mechanisms:
  Mitochondrial Support: Caproic triglyceride (C6) is converted to ketones (beta-hydroxybutyrate) in the liver, which serve as an alternative energy substrate for mitochondria; ketones can be used by brain mitochondria when glucose metabolism is impaired, supporting ATP production and mitochondrial function
  Neurochemical Balance: Ketones produced from caproic triglyceride provide ATP through mitochondrial metabolism; ATP is essential for neurotransmitter synthesis, release, and reuptake, indirectly supporting neurochemical balance by ensuring adequate energy for neuronal function

## Overview

Caproic triglyceride (tricaproin) is a medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) containing three caproic acid (C6) molecules. It is a component of MCT oil and provides rapid brain energy via ketone production. Caproic acid (C6) is the shortest of the common MCTs and contributes to the overall ketone-producing effects of MCT formulations.
