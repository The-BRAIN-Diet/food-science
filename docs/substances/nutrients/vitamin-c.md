mechanisms:
  Inflammation: Antioxidant properties; supports anti-inflammatory effects
  Oxidative Stress: Key water-soluble antioxidant; works within antioxidant network with vitamin E, CoQ10, and polyphenols
  Hormonal Response: Supports norepinephrine synthesis as cofactor
  Stress Response: Supports stress response through antioxidant and neurochemical effects
  Neurochemical Balance: Supports norepinephrine synthesis; transported in brain via SVCT2

## Overview

Vitamin C is a key water-soluble antioxidant that supports non-heme iron absorption and protects neuronal membranes. It is transported in the brain via SVCT2 (sodium-dependent vitamin C transporter 2), maintaining brain ascorbate levels. Vitamin C works synergistically within the antioxidant network alongside vitamin E, CoQ10, lipoic acid, and glutathione. As a cofactor for norepinephrine synthesis, vitamin C supports attention, arousal, and executive modulation. Spacing polyphenol-rich beverages (tea/coffee) from iron-rich plant meals or adding vitamin C sources improves iron uptake, with practical pairings including citrus, bell peppers, and other vitamin C-rich foods with iron sources.
