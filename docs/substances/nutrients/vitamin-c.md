## Overview

Vitamin C is a key water‑soluble antioxidant; supports non‑heme iron absorption and protects neuronal membranes; transported in brain via SVCT2.

## From the paper

- Spacing tea/coffee from iron‑rich plant meals or adding vitamin C improves iron uptake; SVCT2 maintains brain ascorbate.
