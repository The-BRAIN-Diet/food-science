## Overview

Selenium supports glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and other antioxidant systems, protecting membranes and mitochondria from oxidative damage. It is included among trace minerals essential for antioxidant networks, working synergistically with other antioxidants like vitamin E, vitamin C, and glutathione to maintain redox balance in the brain and throughout the body.
