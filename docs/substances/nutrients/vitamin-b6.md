description: PLP cofactor for neurotransmitter synthesis; relies on brain PDXK activation
---

## Overview

Vitamin B6 is converted to PLP in the brain, serving as a cofactor for synthesis of dopamine, serotonin, GABA, and more; activation depends on PDXK with magnesium/ATP support.

## From the paper

- Combined B6 and magnesium reduced inattention/hyperactivity in reports; plant-based diets and certain conditions raise deficiency risk.
