## Overview

Vitamin B6 is converted to PLP in the brain, serving as a cofactor for synthesis of dopamine, serotonin, GABA, and more; activation depends on PDXK with magnesium/ATP support.

## Biological Roles

### Neurotransmitter Synthesis Cofactor

B6 is a cofactor in the development of all the key neurotransmitters presented above (Table X). Only once pyridoxine (PIN), pyridoxal (PAL), pyridoxamine (PAM) (Spector 1978) cross the blood–brain barrier in their non-phosphorylated forms, can they be converted into pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP or P5P), the active coenzyme form. This means that systemic supplementation with PLP does not bypass the brain's reliance on its own enzymatic machinery. Instead, they require pyridoxal kinase (PDXK) activity, which is supported by cofactors such as **magnesium** and ATP (paper.txt, line 359).

### Dopamine Synthesis

**Dopamine:** Attention, motivation, executive function; DMN-to-task switching. Cofactors: Tyrosine, phenylalanine; iron, **B6**, folate, omega-3s. Food sources: Lean poultry, beef, fish, dairy, soy, pumpkin seeds; omega-3 rich fish. Protein-rich breakfasts; pair with anti-inflammatory nutrients to protect DMN switching; avoid chronic over-reward from ultra-processed foods (paper.txt, line 346).

Moderate carbohydrate intake reduces competition at the LAT1 transporter. Crucially, both pathways and their respective enzymes rely on the Cofactors (iron, **B6**, folate, omega-3s and BH₄(tetrahydrobiopterin)(Fanet et al. 2021)) to support the rate-limiting steps in catecholamine synthesis. These nutrients, along with omega-3 fatty acids also support LAT1 transport, membrane fluidity and neurotransmitter production (paper.txt, line 377).

### Serotonin Synthesis

**Serotonin:** Mood regulation, emotional control, impulse moderation. Cofactors: Tryptophan; **B6**, magnesium; carb co-ingestion to aid LAT1 transport. Food sources: Turkey, eggs, dairy, soy, seeds, oats, bananas. Pair tryptophan-rich proteins with moderate carbs to increase Trp:LNAA ratio; timing midday or evening for calming effect (paper.txt, line 348).

### GABA Synthesis

**GABA:** Main inhibitory neurotransmitter; calms neural activity, supports sleep. Cofactors: Glutamate (from protein), **B6**, Magnesium functions as an NMDA receptor antagonist and GABA receptor modulator (Clerc et al. 2013), Zinc – acts as an allosteric modulator of the GABA receptor (Peralta and Huidobro-Toro 2016) (paper.txt, line 349).

### Glutamate Regulation

**Glutamate:** Principal excitatory neurotransmitter; learning, memory, cognition and mood deficits. Cofactors: Glutamine (from protein), **B6**, magnesium, zinc. Food sources: Lentils, poultry, fish, spinach, pumpkin seeds. Maintain magnesium & antioxidant intake to prevent excitotoxicity; balance with GABA-supporting foods in evening (paper.txt, line 345).

### Methylation Support

B vitamins, particularly **B6**, B2, folate (5-MTHF), and B12, are essential cofactors in the remethylation of homocysteine (Hcy) to methionine, which is subsequently converted to S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) (paper.txt, line 478).

Riboflavin (B2) is a precursor to the key coenzymes FMN (Flavin mononucleotide) and FAD Flavin adenine dinucleotide. FAD acts as a critical cofactor for MTHFR, linking riboflavin to homocysteine recycling and methylation capacity. Riboflavin coenzymes facilitate the metabolism also of B12, vitamin **B6**, and niacin (Aragão et al. 2024) (paper.txt, line 479).

### CoQ10 Synthesis

Low levels of the coenzyme **B6** can cause dysfunctions, prior to the formation of vitamin Q10, to DNA (Pravst, Zmitek, and Zmitek 2010) (paper.txt, line 679).

## Activation in the Brain

### PDXK Dependency

In ADHD, genetic variations and enzymatic inefficiencies may influence PDXK activity and thus PLP availability, potentially impairing neurotransmitter synthesis. Clinical evidence supports this: combined B6 and magnesium supplementation has been reported to reduce inattention and hyperactivity (M Mousain-Bosc 1 2006) (Mousain-Bosc et al., 2006) (paper.txt, line 361).

### Cofactor Requirements

PDXK activity is supported by cofactors such as **magnesium** and ATP (paper.txt, line 359).

## Deficiency Risk Factors

Since plant-based diets provide less bioavailable B6, deficiencies are more common in vegan and older populations (Waldmann et al. 2006) (Wilson et al. 2019) researched b6 deficiencies and found celiac disease, alcoholism and genetic mutations can lead to very poor absorption and deficiency leading to serious brain injury and epilepsy (paper.txt, line 361).

## Supplementation Considerations

- **Combined B6 and magnesium** supplementation has been reported to reduce inattention and hyperactivity (M Mousain-Bosc 1 2006) (Mousain-Bosc et al., 2006)
- **PLP supplementation does not bypass brain's PDXK requirement** - the brain must activate B6 itself
- **Magnesium is required** for PDXK activity
- **Plant-based diets** provide less bioavailable B6
- **Deficiency risk factors:** celiac disease, alcoholism, genetic mutations

## Practical Notes

- **Plant sources** have lower bioavailability than animal sources
- **Pair with magnesium** for optimal PDXK activation
- **Morning meals** - B6, iron, vitamin C for dopamine synthesis
- **Fortified foods** (nutritional yeast, plant milks) can help close gaps
- **Genetic variations** may affect PDXK activity and B6 needs
