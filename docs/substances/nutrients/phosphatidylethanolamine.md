  Endocannabinoid System: Key brain phospholipid that can convert to PC or N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamines (NAPEs); NAPEs are precursors to N-acyl ethanolamines (NAEs) like palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), oleoylethanolamide (OEA), and anandamide (AEA), bioactive lipids which act as neuromodulators with anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, and mood-regulating effects

## Overview

Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) is a key brain phospholipid and potential ADHD biomarker. PE can be converted into phosphatidylcholine (PC) or N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamines (NAPEs). These NAPEs are precursors to N-acyl ethanolamines (NAEs) like palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), oleoylethanolamide (OEA), and anandamide (AEA), bioactive lipids which act as neuromodulators with anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, and mood-regulating effects. Supporting NAPEs production through diet via PE-rich foods like eggs, fish roe, and liver may enhance endocannabinoid system tone. Clinical trials have shown a doubling of plasma levels after dietary increases in oat bran due to its rich PE content.
