## Overview

Leucine is an essential branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) supporting protein synthesis and recovery through mTOR signaling. It is indirectly relevant to brain health via metabolic signaling and neurotransmitter demand. Leucine participates in LAT1 competition dynamics at the blood-brain barrier, along with other large neutral amino acids, affecting the transport of neurotransmitter precursors like tryptophan and tyrosine.
