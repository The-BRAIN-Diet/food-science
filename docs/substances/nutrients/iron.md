# Iron

## Overview

Iron is an essential mineral that plays a critical role in oxygen transport, energy production, and brain function. Iron is critical for oxygen delivery and catecholamine synthesis; heme iron is more bioavailable than non‑heme. The paper highlights iron's complex relationship with ADHD, noting that while iron deficiency can contribute to symptoms, iron supplementation has not proven consistently effective in relieving ADHD symptoms.

## From the paper

- Pair non‑heme iron with vitamin C; manage inhibitors (tea/coffee timing); deficiency linked to cognitive and mood symptoms.

## Role in Brain Health

Iron is essential for:

- **Oxygen delivery to the brain** via hemoglobin
- **Dopamine synthesis** as a cofactor for tyrosine hydroxylase (the rate-limiting enzyme in dopamine production)
- **Mitochondrial function** and energy production
- **Neurotransmitter regulation**
- **Myelin synthesis**
- **Cognitive development and function**

## Iron and ADHD: Complex Relationship

### Research Findings

- **Iron supplementation has not proven effective** in relieving ADHD symptoms
- **Lower serum ferritin levels** found in ADHD patients compared to controls
- **Iron catalyzes reactions that increase oxidative stress**, which may contribute to ADHD symptoms
- **Relationship with ferritin** is crucial for understanding iron status

### Ferritin's Role

Ferritin, an intracellular protein that stores iron and regulates its release:

- **Limits free iron** that can produce oxidative radicals
- **Lower levels in ADHD patients** imply reduced iron regulation
- **Results in more free iron** and potentially increased oxidative stress
- **May contribute to ADHD pathogenesis** through oxidative damage

## Dietary Considerations

### Absorption Rate

- **Highly variable** (14–18% from supplements)
- **Heme iron** from animal sources is **2–3× more bioavailable** than non-heme iron
- **Non-heme iron** absorption can be enhanced with vitamin C

### RDA (Recommended Daily Allowance)

- **8 mg** for men
- **18 mg** for women
- **27 mg** for pregnant women

### Supplementation Notes

- Many iron supplements provide more than the RDA to compensate for low absorption rates
- **Timing matters**: BID (twice daily) dosing may be more effective for some forms
- **Individual response varies** significantly

## Food Sources

### Heme Iron (Higher Bioavailability)

- **Red meat** (beef, lamb)
- **Organ meats** (liver, heart)
- **Poultry** (dark meat)
- **Fish and shellfish**

### Non-Heme Iron (Lower Bioavailability)

- **Legumes** (lentils, chickpeas, beans)
- **Leafy green vegetables** (spinach, kale)
- **Nuts and seeds** (pumpkin seeds, cashews)
- **Whole grains** (quinoa, oats)
- **Tofu and fortified foods**

## Enhancement Strategies

### Vitamin C Pairing

- **Significantly improves non-heme iron absorption** by reducing ferric to ferrous iron
- **Up to fourfold increase** in absorption when consumed together
- **Examples**: Citrus fruits, bell peppers, tomatoes with iron-rich plant foods

### Preparation Methods

- **Soaking and sprouting** legumes can reduce phytates and improve iron bioavailability
- **Fermentation** can enhance iron absorption from grains
- **Cooking methods** that preserve vitamin C content

## Integration with BRAIN Diet

The BRAIN diet addresses iron needs through:

- **Strategic food combinations** (iron + vitamin C)
- **Preparation techniques** that improve bioavailability
- **Recognition of iron's dual role** in both supporting and potentially harming brain health
- **Balance between iron sufficiency and oxidative stress prevention**

## Clinical Considerations

### Testing

- **Serum iron** (may not reflect tissue status)
- **Ferritin levels** (more reliable indicator of iron stores)
- **Transferrin saturation** (indicates iron availability)
- **Complete blood count** (CBC) for anemia assessment

### Risk Factors for Deficiency

- **Vegetarian/vegan diets**
- **Heavy menstrual periods**
- **Gastrointestinal conditions**
- **Chronic inflammation**

### Risk Factors for Excess

- **Genetic conditions** (hemochromatosis)
- **Excessive supplementation**
- **Chronic inflammation** (elevates ferritin)

## Synergistic Effects

Iron works synergistically with:

- **Vitamin C** for enhanced absorption
- **B vitamins** for neurotransmitter synthesis
- **Copper** for iron metabolism
- **Vitamin A** for iron mobilization

## Notes

Iron's relationship with ADHD and brain health is complex and requires careful consideration. While iron is essential for brain function, the BRAIN diet emphasizes the importance of maintaining iron balance rather than simply increasing intake. The diet's focus on whole foods, strategic food combinations, and preparation methods helps optimize iron status while minimizing potential oxidative stress.
