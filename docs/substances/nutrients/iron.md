## Overview

Iron is critical for oxygen delivery and catecholamine synthesis; heme iron is more bioavailable than non-heme.

## Biological Roles

### Dopamine Synthesis

Iron is an essential cofactor for tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the conversion of tyrosine to dopamine (Beard et al., 2003; Erikson et al., 2000). Pairing plant-based iron sources with citrus (Hallberg et al. 1989) fat-soluble vitamins with avocado or olive oil, or spreading minerals across meals are simple but impactful strategies that support maximising dietary nutrition (paper.txt, line 289).

**Dopamine:** Attention, motivation, executive function; DMN-to-task switching. Cofactors: Tyrosine, phenylalanine; **iron**, B6, folate, omega-3s. Food sources: Lean poultry, beef, fish, dairy, soy, pumpkin seeds; omega-3 rich fish. Protein-rich breakfasts; pair with anti-inflammatory nutrients to protect DMN switching; avoid chronic over-reward from ultra-processed foods (paper.txt, line 346).

Moderate carbohydrate intake reduces competition at the LAT1 transporter. Crucially, both pathways and their respective enzymes rely on the Cofactors (**iron**, B6, folate, omega-3s and BH₄(tetrahydrobiopterin)(Fanet et al. 2021)) to support the rate-limiting steps in catecholamine synthesis. These nutrients, along with omega-3 fatty acids also support LAT1 transport, membrane fluidity and neurotransmitter production (paper.txt, line 377).

### Oxygen Delivery

Iron (heme & non-heme): Oxygen delivery to brain, dopamine synthesis (paper.txt, line 286).

### Heavy Metal Detoxification

Repleting essential minerals (calcium, **iron**, zinc) together with dietary fibres, phytates, and polyphenols reduces gastrointestinal absorption of toxic metals (lead, cadmium, mercury, aluminium). This lowers systemic levels and blood–brain barrier transport, reduces brain metal accumulation, and ultimately decreases oxidative-stress burden and neurotransmission disruption (Zhai et al.) (Berglund et al. 1994) (paper.txt, line 663).

In women, a high-fiber (vegetarian) pattern showed near-complete fecal recovery of dietary cadmium and no increase in blood/urine Cd despite higher Cd intake, suggesting fibre/phytate-mediated inhibition of absorption; **low ferritin** was the key predictor of higher body Cd (Berglund et al. 1994) (paper.txt, line 659).

Dietary patterns common in ADHD (e.g. low micronutrient density, irregular meals, high sugar/processed food intake) can increase absorption of toxic metals while also sometimes containing lower competing minerals like calcium, **iron**, and zinc which bind to toxic metals (Zhai et al. 2015) (paper.txt, line 670).

### SIBO and Absorption

Similarly, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) impairs absorption of vitamin B12, **iron**, and tryptophan, depriving the brain of essential neurotransmitter precursors (paper.txt, line 511).

Overgrowth Suppression (SIBO, Candida, Pathobionts): Polyphenol antimicrobials (berberine, oregano, green tea); short-term low-FODMAP when needed; prokinetic foods (ginger); Green-MED + fermented food diet - ↓ SIBO recurrence, ↓ LPS translocation, ↑ nutrient absorption (B12, **iron**, tryptophan), ↑ SCFA resilience (paper.txt, line 573).

## Heme vs Non-Heme Iron

Heme iron from animal sources is 2–3× more bioavailable than non-heme iron from plant sources (paper.txt, line 286).

## Food Sources

## Bioavailability Enhancement Strategies

### Vitamin C Pairing

Pairing plant-based **iron** sources with citrus (Hallberg et al. 1989) fat-soluble vitamins with avocado or olive oil, or spreading minerals across meals are simple but impactful strategies that support maximising dietary nutrition (paper.txt, line 289).

**Absorption note:** Polyphenol-rich beverages (tea/coffee) can reduce non-heme **iron** absorption if taken with iron-rich plant meals; spacing them ≥1 hour away or adding vitamin-C sources (e.g., lemon) favors iron uptake (paper.txt, line 256).

**Food Sources of Vitamin C for Pairing:**
- [Lemon](../foods/lemon.md) - High vitamin C, enhances iron absorption (up to 4× increase)
- [Oranges](../foods/oranges.md) - High vitamin C, enhances iron absorption
- [Bell Peppers](../foods/bell-peppers.md) - Very high vitamin C
- [Tomatoes](../foods/tomatoes.md) - Vitamin C, lycopene
- [Citrus](../foods/citrus.md) (general) - High vitamin C

### Phytate Reduction

Phytates can bind essential minerals such as zinc, **iron**, and calcium, potentially impairing their absorption, they can also exhibit antioxidant properties, and have been associated with reduced risk of kidney stones and some cancers (Taylor et al. 2009) (paper.txt, line 197).

**Soaking & Sprouting Strategies:** Reduces phytates in legumes/grains, improving non-heme **iron** and zinc bioavailability; germination can increase GABA and antioxidant content, supporting neurotransmitter balance (GREINER and KONIETZNY 1999) (paper.txt, line 205).

Sprouting, soaking, and boiling reduce antinutrients, improving mineral bioavailability (e.g., zinc, **iron** etc) that serve as cofactors for dopamine and serotonin pathways, supporting neurotransmitter synthesis (Greiner & Konietzny, 1999) (paper.txt, line 222).

**Optimal Bean Soaking:** Optimal conditions for the endogenous phytases of black beans, is 60C and pH 6.0, that resulted in a 55% reduction in 1P6 after soaking and cooking (GREINER and KONIETZNY 1999) (paper.txt, line 1048).

### Oxalate Reduction

Boiling spinach, kale, and other greens can reduce oxalate load, improving mineral bioavailability; excess oxalate may disrupt mitochondrial function and redox status (Chai and Liebman 2005) (paper.txt, line 207).

The BRAIN diet specifically targets leafy green vegetables i.e. kale and spinach that are rich in **iron**, magnesium, and zinc this can introduce high dietary oxalate. Oxalate binds to these minerals and forms insoluble compounds, which significantly reduces their bioavailability (Chaiyarit and Thongboonkerd 2020) (paper.txt, line 1036).

### Fat Pairing

Pairing plant-based iron sources with citrus (Hallberg et al. 1989) **fat-soluble vitamins with avocado or olive oil**, or spreading minerals across meals are simple but impactful strategies that support maximising dietary nutrition (paper.txt, line 289).

## Deficiency and ADHD

Other common deficiencies, particularly linked with children, are iodine and **iron** ("WHO Micronutrient Deficiencies" 2025) (paper.txt, line 245).

Vegan versions of the protocol must address key nutrients that are rarely adequate through vegan whole foods alone. These include vitamin B12, DHA/EPA, choline, taurine, carnosine, creatine, and bioavailable **iron** and zinc (paper.txt, line 258).

## Supplementation Considerations

Where food alone cannot achieve sufficiency, strategic supplementation is justified. Essential nutrients such as methylcobalamin and **iron** (especially in forms with higher bioavailability, such as liposomal iron) must be prioritized to prevent deficiency and support cognitive health (paper.txt, line 261).

## Practical Notes

- **Heme iron** (animal sources) is 2-3× more bioavailable than non-heme
- **Pair non-heme iron with vitamin C** (citrus, bell peppers, tomatoes) for enhanced absorption
- **Soak and sprout** legumes/grains to reduce phytates
- **Boil leafy greens** to reduce oxalates
- **Space tea/coffee ≥1 hour** from iron-rich plant meals or add lemon
- **Pair with fat** (avocado, olive oil) for optimal absorption
- **Spread minerals across meals** for better absorption
- **Address SIBO** if present, as it impairs iron absorption
