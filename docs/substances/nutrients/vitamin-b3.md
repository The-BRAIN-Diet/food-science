## Overview

Niacin (vitamin B3) replenishes NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide), supporting oxidative phosphorylation, sirtuin signaling, and mitochondrial biogenesis. It is key for neuronal energy metabolism, as NAD+ is essential for ATP production in mitochondria. High-dose niacin has been shown to restore blood and muscle NAD+ levels and improve performance in mitochondrial myopathy, highlighting its importance for mitochondrial function. Dietary sources include various foods that contribute to NAD+ precursor availability in the BRAIN Diet.
