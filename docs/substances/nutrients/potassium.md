## Overview

Potassium is an essential mineral and electrolyte that plays a vital role in maintaining proper nerve function, muscle contractions, and fluid balance. It is critical for membrane potential, nerve signaling, and cardiovascular regulation, with adequate intake balancing sodium effects. Green tea contributes manganese and small amounts of fluoride and potassium, alongside polyphenols that support antioxidant defenses. The BRAIN Diet emphasizes nutrient-dense whole foods, many of which are naturally rich in potassium, including fruits, vegetables, legumes, and nuts.
