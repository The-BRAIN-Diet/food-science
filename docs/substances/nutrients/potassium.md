# Potassium

## Overview

Potassium is an essential mineral and electrolyte that plays a vital role in maintaining proper nerve function, muscle contractions, and fluid balance. Potassium is critical for membrane potential, nerve signaling, and cardiovascular regulation; adequate intake balances sodium effects. While the paper doesn't provide extensive specific details about potassium, it's mentioned in the context of overall cardiovascular health and electrolyte balance.

## Role in Brain Health

Potassium is essential for:

- Maintaining proper nerve impulse transmission
- Supporting muscle function and coordination
- Regulating blood pressure
- Supporting cognitive function and brain health

## Dietary Considerations

### Sources

- Fruits (bananas, oranges, avocados)
- Vegetables (spinach, potatoes, tomatoes)
- Legumes (beans, lentils)
- Dairy products
- Nuts and seeds

### Recommendations

- Follow standard dietary guidelines for potassium intake
- Balance with sodium intake for optimal cardiovascular health
- Consider individual health conditions and kidney function

## Integration with BRAIN Diet

The BRAIN diet emphasizes nutrient-dense whole foods, many of which are naturally rich in potassium. The diet's focus on fruits, vegetables, legumes, and nuts provides excellent sources of this essential mineral.

## Notes

The BRAIN diet's emphasis on whole foods and minimal processing naturally supports adequate potassium intake while helping maintain the sodium-potassium balance important for cardiovascular and brain health.
