# Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin)

## Overview

Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) is a water-soluble vitamin that plays a crucial role in brain development, cognitive function, and the maintenance of the nervous system. Vitamin B12 is essential for methylation, myelin integrity, and mitochondrial metabolism (methylmalonyl-CoA → succinyl-CoA). Deficiency impairs cognition and mood. The paper highlights B12 as essential for methylation processes and brain health, with particular relevance for ADHD and cognitive function.

## Biological Roles

### Myelin Synthesis

Vitamin B12: Myelin synthesis, methylation, neurotransmitter production (paper.txt, line 283).

Cholesterol being essential for synapse formation, **myelin integrity**, and the production of steroid-based neurohormones (Pfrieger 2003) (paper.txt, line 416).

### Methylation Support

B vitamins, particularly B6, B2, folate (5-MTHF), and **B12**, are essential cofactors in the remethylation of homocysteine (Hcy) to methionine, which is subsequently converted to S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) (paper.txt, line 478).

A large meta analysis shows that folic acid supplementation (0.5-5 mg/day) typically reduces plasma homocysteine by ~25% (from ~12 µmol/L to ~8-9 µmol/L. In those studies, adding **B12** gave an additional ~7% reduction over folate alone (Collaboration 1998). However while folate (vitamin B9) is normally considered to be the primary nutrient for homocysteine reduction, long chain ω-3 fatty acids and vitamin **B12** also contribute meaningfully and in combination more effectively. For example one study with 3 groups taking supplementations of 1: vitamin B-12, 2: fish oil, and 3: vitamin B-12+fish oil, lowered plasma Hcy concentrations by 22%, 19%, and 39%, respectively (Tao Huang et al. 2015). A reanalysis of the VITACOG trial data further demonstrated that B vitamin supplementation slowed cognitive decline only in participants with adequate omega-3 status (Oulhaj et al. 2016) (Oulhaj et al. 2016) (paper.txt, line 480).

Dietary patterns can modulate gene expression and epigenetic regulation through multiple pathways, although the strength of evidence varies by gene. For example, nutrients involved in one-carbon metabolism (e.g., folate, riboflavin, **B12**, choline) can influence methylation dynamics relevant to MTHFR and COMT activity (paper.txt, line 484).

### Mitochondrial Energy Production

Cobalamin (B12): is crucial role in its involvement in the conversion of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA, a key step in mitochondrial energy production. A deficiency in B12 can lead to a buildup of methylmalonic acid and odd-chain fatty acids, which are neurotoxic and contribute to myelin sheath damage. This disruption is linked to symptoms such as memory loss, brain fog, depression, and even early signs of dementia, vitamin B12 deficiency may even lead to dementia and psychosis, suggesting a broader dependence of the brain on B12, it is also commonly deficient in vegetarians (Pawlak et al. 2013) (paper.txt, line 726).

### Neurotransmitter Production

Vitamin B12: Myelin synthesis, methylation, **neurotransmitter production** (paper.txt, line 283).

### Deficiency Consequences

Deficiency causes cognitive decline, mood disorders, neuropathy (paper.txt, line 283).

## Food Sources

### Animal Sources (Bioavailable Cobalamin)

**Organ Meats:**
- [Liver](../../foods/liver.md) - **Highest source** of bioavailable B12, retinol, heme iron, folate

**Seafood:**

- [Liver](../../foods/liver.md) - **Highest source** of bioavailable B12, retinol, heme iron, folate

**Seafood:**

- [Clams](../../foods/clams.md) - **High B12**, taurine, heme iron
- [Fish](../../foods/salmon.md) (general) - B12, omega-3, protein
- [Salmon](../../foods/salmon.md) - Omega-3, protein, B vitamins including **B12**
- [Sardines](../../foods/sardines.md) - Omega-3, CoQ10, **B12**

**Eggs & Dairy:**

- [Eggs](../../foods/eggs.md) - Complete protein, choline, B6, **B12**
- [Milk](../../foods/milk.md) - Complete protein, nicotinamide riboside, **B12**
- [Yogurt](../../foods/yogurt.md) - Probiotics, protein, **B12**
- [Kefir](../../foods/kefir.md) - Diverse probiotics, **B12**
- [Cheese](../../foods/cheese.md) - Calcium, protein, **B12**
- [Parmesan Cheese](../../foods/parmesan-cheese.md) - CLA, K2, glutamate, high protein, **B12**

### Plant Sources (Limited - Fortified or Functional Foods)

**Fortified Sources:**

- [Fortified Plant Milks](../../foods/fortified-plant-milks.md) - **B12** fortified (methylcobalamin preferred)
- [Nutritional Yeast](../../foods/nutritional-yeast.md) - Fortified with **B12, B6**, NAD+ precursors

**Functional Plant Foods:**

- [Mankai](../../foods/mankai.md) (duckweed, Wolffia globosa) - **Iron, B12** for vegan nutrient gaps (paper.txt, line 259)
- [Chlorella](../../foods/chlorella.md) - Contains bioavailable, **true vitamin B12 (cobalamin)**, confirmed in animal feeding trials, and may help close vegan nutrient gaps. By contrast, spirulina is dominated by pseudovitamin B12 analogues, which are inactive in humans and therefore unsuitable as a primary B12 source (Watanabe et al. 2002) (Watanabe et al. 2002) (paper.txt, line 260)

**Note:** Vitamin B₁₂ (also present in Wolffia globosa) (paper.txt, line 266).

## Bioavailability Considerations

### Vegan/Vegetarian Diets

Vegan versions of the protocol must address key nutrients that are rarely adequate through vegan whole foods alone. These include vitamin **B12**, DHA/EPA, choline, taurine, carnosine, creatine, and bioavailable iron and zinc (paper.txt, line 258).

(Katonova et al. 2022) note that while vegan diets are low in saturated fats and cholesterol and rich in antioxidants and fibre, they can lack vitamin **B12**, vitamin D, DHA, and certain minerals, all of which are critical for brain health. Supporting this concern, (Jigeer et al. 2025) found that vegetarians in their 80s had higher odds of cognitive impairment compared to omnivores, likely due to deficiencies in **B12**, EPA/DHA, and zinc (paper.txt, line 273).

### SIBO and Absorption

Similarly, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) impairs absorption of vitamin **B12**, iron, and tryptophan, depriving the brain of essential neurotransmitter precursors (paper.txt, line 511).

Overgrowth Suppression (SIBO, Candida, Pathobionts): Polyphenol antimicrobials (berberine, oregano, green tea); short-term low-FODMAP when needed; prokinetic foods (ginger); Green-MED + fermented food diet - ↓ SIBO recurrence, ↓ LPS translocation, ↑ nutrient absorption (**B12**, iron, tryptophan), ↑ SCFA resilience (paper.txt, line 573).

## Supplementation Considerations

Where food alone cannot achieve sufficiency, strategic supplementation is justified. Essential nutrients such as **methylcobalamin** and iron (especially in forms with higher bioavailability, such as liposomal iron) must be prioritized to prevent deficiency and support cognitive health (paper.txt, line 261).

Targets foods providing essential brain supporting vitamins: D (UV-exposed mushrooms; fortified plant milks/yogurts), **B12** (fortified plant milks, nutritional yeast), and B6(chickpeas, potatoes, bananas, whole grains, soy). When dietary targets aren't met on a given day, fortified foods or supplements can help maintain coverage (paper.txt, line 752).

## Synergy with Other Nutrients

### Folate and Omega-3 Synergy

A large meta analysis shows that folic acid supplementation (0.5-5 mg/day) typically reduces plasma homocysteine by ~25% (from ~12 µmol/L to ~8-9 µmol/L. In those studies, adding **B12** gave an additional ~7% reduction over **folate** alone (Collaboration 1998). However while folate (vitamin B9) is normally considered to be the primary nutrient for homocysteine reduction, long chain ω-3 fatty acids and vitamin **B12** also contribute meaningfully and in combination more effectively. For example one study with 3 groups taking supplementations of 1: vitamin B-12, 2: fish oil, and 3: vitamin B-12+fish oil, lowered plasma Hcy concentrations by 22%, 19%, and 39%, respectively (Tao Huang et al. 2015). A reanalysis of the VITACOG trial data further demonstrated that B vitamin supplementation slowed cognitive decline only in participants with adequate **omega-3** status (Oulhaj et al. 2016) (Oulhaj et al. 2016) (paper.txt, line 480).

### B2 (Riboflavin) Support

Riboflavin (B2) is a precursor to the key coenzymes FMN (Flavin mononucleotide) and FAD Flavin adenine dinucleotide. FAD acts as a critical cofactor for MTHFR, linking riboflavin to homocysteine recycling and methylation capacity. Riboflavin coenzymes facilitate the metabolism also of **B12**, vitamin B6, and niacin (Aragão et al. 2024) (paper.txt, line 479).

## Deficiency and ADHD

Research indicates that deficiencies in vitamins and minerals essential for methylation, such as folate, vitamin **B12**, and zinc, are correlated to ADHD symptoms and that supplementing these micronutrients has shown potential in supporting methylation and reducing symptom severity (Razavinia et al. 2024) (paper.txt, line 245).

## Practical Notes
