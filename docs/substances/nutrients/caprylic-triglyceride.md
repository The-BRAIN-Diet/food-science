mechanisms:
  Mitochondrial Support: Caprylic triglyceride (C8) is converted to ketones (beta-hydroxybutyrate) in the liver, which serve as an alternative energy substrate for mitochondria; ketones can be used by brain mitochondria when glucose metabolism is impaired, supporting ATP production and mitochondrial function
  Neurochemical Balance: Ketones produced from caprylic triglyceride provide ATP through mitochondrial metabolism; ATP is essential for neurotransmitter synthesis, release, and reuptake, indirectly supporting neurochemical balance by ensuring adequate energy for neuronal function

## Overview

Caprylic triglyceride (trioctanoin) is a medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) containing three caprylic acid (C8) molecules. It is one of the primary components of MCT oil and provides rapid brain energy via ketone production. Caprylic acid (C8) is particularly effective at producing ketones and is often the preferred MCT for brain energy support.
