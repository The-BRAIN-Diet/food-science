## Overview

Vitamin E is a lipid-phase antioxidant that protects polyunsaturated fatty acids, particularly DHA, in neuronal membranes from peroxidation, supporting neuronal integrity and antioxidant networks. It works synergistically within the antioxidant network alongside vitamin C, CoQ10, lipoic acid, and glutathione, with these compounds regenerating each other in vivo. The BRAIN Diet emphasizes food-based sources rich in balanced antioxidants rather than high-dose single-nutrient supplementation, highlighting synergy in whole foods.
