mechanisms:
  Mitochondrial Support: Capric triglyceride (C10) is converted to ketones (beta-hydroxybutyrate) in the liver, which serve as an alternative energy substrate for mitochondria; ketones can be used by brain mitochondria when glucose metabolism is impaired, supporting ATP production and mitochondrial function
  Neurochemical Balance: Ketones produced from capric triglyceride provide ATP through mitochondrial metabolism; ATP is essential for neurotransmitter synthesis, release, and reuptake, indirectly supporting neurochemical balance by ensuring adequate energy for neuronal function

## Overview

Capric triglyceride (tridecanoin) is a medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) containing three capric acid (C10) molecules. It is one of the primary components of MCT oil and provides rapid brain energy via ketone production. Capric acid (C10) works synergistically with caprylic acid (C8) in MCT formulations to support brain energy metabolism.
