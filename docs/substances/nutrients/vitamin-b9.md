## Overview

Folate supports one-carbon metabolism and remethylation of homocysteine to methionine → SAMe, influencing neurotransmitter synthesis and membrane phospholipid methylation.

## Biological Roles

### Methylation and Homocysteine Recycling

Methylation is a fundamental biochemical process by which methyl groups (–CH₃) are added to molecules, playing a pivotal role in neurotransmitter synthesis, phospholipid metabolism, and gene expression. In the context of ADHD, nutrient-dependent methylation supports the recycling of homocysteine into methionine, a precursor to S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), the body's universal methyl donor. SAMe not only fuels the synthesis of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin, but also drives phospholipid methylation in neuronal membranes essential for membrane fluidity, signal transduction, and neurotransmitter receptor function (paper.txt, line 477).

B vitamins, particularly B6, B2, **folate (5-MTHF)**, and B12, are essential cofactors in the remethylation of homocysteine (Hcy) to methionine, which is subsequently converted to S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) (paper.txt, line 478).

### Homocysteine Reduction

A large meta analysis shows that **folic acid** supplementation (0.5-5 mg/day) typically reduces plasma homocysteine by ~25% (from ~12 µmol/L to ~8-9 µmol/L. In those studies, adding B12 gave an additional ~7% reduction over folate alone (Collaboration 1998). However while **folate (vitamin B9)** is normally considered to be the primary nutrient for homocysteine reduction, long chain ω-3 fatty acids and vitamin B12 also contribute meaningfully and in combination more effectively. For example one study with 3 groups taking supplementations of 1: vitamin B-12, 2: fish oil, and 3: vitamin B-12+fish oil, lowered plasma Hcy concentrations by 22%, 19%, and 39%, respectively (Tao Huang et al. 2015). A reanalysis of the VITACOG trial data further demonstrated that B vitamin supplementation slowed cognitive decline only in participants with adequate omega-3 status (Oulhaj et al. 2016) (Oulhaj et al. 2016) (paper.txt, line 480).

Elevated plasma homocysteine, a byproduct of methylation, is frequently elevated in ADHD and other neurodegenerative disorders (Yu et al. 2020), (Luzzi et al. 2022), cognitive impairment, and psychiatric conditions (Lukovac et al. 2024a). Hcy is implicated in the induction of oxidative stress, the modulation of oxygen levels, and the initiation of lipid peroxidation pathway (Lukovac et al. 2024b) (paper.txt, line 482).

### MTHFR Genetic Considerations

These pathways are vulnerable to genetic variants such as **MTHFR polymorphisms**, which reduce the efficiency of folate cycling and methylation, thereby increasing susceptibility to cognitive dysfunction and ADHD-related symptoms (paper.txt, line 483).

Riboflavin (B2) is a precursor to the key coenzymes FMN (Flavin mononucleotide) and FAD Flavin adenine dinucleotide. FAD acts as a critical cofactor for **MTHFR**, linking riboflavin to homocysteine recycling and methylation capacity. Riboflavin coenzymes facilitate the metabolism also of B12, vitamin B6, and niacin (Aragão et al. 2024) (paper.txt, line 479).

### Neurotransmitter Synthesis

**Dopamine:** Attention, motivation, executive function; DMN-to-task switching. Cofactors: Tyrosine, phenylalanine; iron, B6, **folate**, omega-3s. Food sources: Lean poultry, beef, fish, dairy, soy, pumpkin seeds; omega-3 rich fish. Protein-rich breakfasts; pair with anti-inflammatory nutrients to protect DMN switching; avoid chronic over-reward from ultra-processed foods (paper.txt, line 346).

Moderate carbohydrate intake reduces competition at the LAT1 transporter. Crucially, both pathways and their respective enzymes rely on the Cofactors (iron, B6, **folate**, omega-3s and BH₄(tetrahydrobiopterin)(Fanet et al. 2021)) to support the rate-limiting steps in catecholamine synthesis. These nutrients, along with omega-3 fatty acids also support LAT1 transport, membrane fluidity and neurotransmitter production (paper.txt, line 377).

### ADHD and Deficiency

Research indicates that deficiencies in vitamins and minerals essential for methylation, such as **folate**, vitamin B12, and zinc, are correlated to ADHD symptoms and that supplementing these micronutrients has shown potential in supporting methylation and reducing symptom severity (Razavinia et al. 2024) (paper.txt, line 245).

A large Australian cohort study, discussed in the review by (Millichap and Yee 2012) found that dietary patterns rich in fibre, **folate**, and omega-3 fatty acids were associated with reduced ADHD symptoms (paper.txt, line 245).

### Quercetin Bioavailability

Isoquercetin (glycosylated quercetin) is more completely absorbed than quercetin in the aglycone form, and that the simultaneous ingestion of quercetin with vitamin C, **folate** and additional flavonoids improves bioavailability (Y. Li et al. 2016) (paper.txt, line 675).

## Synergy with Other Nutrients

### B12 and Omega-3 Synergy

A large meta analysis shows that folic acid supplementation (0.5-5 mg/day) typically reduces plasma homocysteine by ~25% (from ~12 µmol/L to ~8-9 µmol/L. In those studies, adding **B12** gave an additional ~7% reduction over folate alone (Collaboration 1998). However while folate (vitamin B9) is normally considered to be the primary nutrient for homocysteine reduction, long chain ω-3 fatty acids and vitamin B12 also contribute meaningfully and in combination more effectively. For example one study with 3 groups taking supplementations of 1: vitamin B-12, 2: fish oil, and 3: vitamin B-12+fish oil, lowered plasma Hcy concentrations by 22%, 19%, and 39%, respectively (Tao Huang et al. 2015). A reanalysis of the VITACOG trial data further demonstrated that B vitamin supplementation slowed cognitive decline only in participants with adequate **omega-3** status (Oulhaj et al. 2016) (Oulhaj et al. 2016) (paper.txt, line 480).

### B2 (Riboflavin) Support

Riboflavin (B2) is a precursor to the key coenzymes FMN (Flavin mononucleotide) and FAD Flavin adenine dinucleotide. FAD acts as a critical cofactor for MTHFR, linking riboflavin to homocysteine recycling and methylation capacity. Riboflavin coenzymes facilitate the metabolism also of B12, vitamin B6, and niacin (Aragão et al. 2024) (paper.txt, line 479).

## MTHFR Polymorphisms

These pathways are vulnerable to genetic variants such as **MTHFR polymorphisms**, which reduce the efficiency of folate cycling and methylation, thereby increasing susceptibility to cognitive dysfunction and ADHD-related symptoms (paper.txt, line 483).

Dietary patterns can modulate gene expression and epigenetic regulation through multiple pathways, although the strength of evidence varies by gene. For example, nutrients involved in one-carbon metabolism (e.g., **folate**, riboflavin, B12, choline) can influence methylation dynamics relevant to MTHFR and COMT activity (paper.txt, line 484).

## Practical Notes

- **Plant sources** (leafy greens, legumes) are primary sources
- **Pair with B12** for enhanced homocysteine reduction
- **Pair with omega-3s** - B vitamin benefits depend on adequate omega-3 status
- **MTHFR polymorphisms** may increase needs
- **5-MTHF form** (methylfolate) may be preferred for those with MTHFR variants
- **Cooking** - Light cooking preserves folate; avoid excessive heat
