## Overview

Folate supports one‑carbon metabolism and remethylation of homocysteine to methionine → SAMe, influencing neurotransmitter synthesis and membrane phospholipid methylation.

## From the paper

- Folic acid reduces homocysteine; synergy with B12 and omega‑3s magnifies effects; MTHFR genotype modulates needs.
