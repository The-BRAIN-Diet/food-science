mechanisms:
  Methylation: Essential cofactor in remethylation of homocysteine to methionine, which is converted to S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe); SAMe fuels synthesis of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin and drives phospholipid methylation in neuronal membranes
  Neurochemical Balance: Supports neurotransmitter synthesis through methylation; cofactor for dopamine synthesis alongside iron, B6, and omega-3s

- Methylation is a fundamental biochemical process playing a pivotal role in neurotransmitter synthesis, phospholipid metabolism, and gene expression; nutrient-dependent methylation supports recycling of homocysteine into methionine
- B vitamins, particularly B6, B2, folate (5-MTHF), and B12, are essential cofactors in remethylation of homocysteine to methionine, which is converted to SAMe
- Folic acid supplementation (0.5-5 mg/day) typically reduces plasma homocysteine by ~25%; adding B12 gives an additional ~7% reduction [Collaboration 1998](/docs/papers/BRAIN-Diet-References#collaboration_homocysteine_1998)
- While folate is normally considered the primary nutrient for homocysteine reduction, long-chain omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin B12 also contribute meaningfully; B12+fish oil lowered plasma homocysteine by 39% [Tao Huang et al. 2015](/docs/papers/BRAIN-Diet-References#huang_effect_2015)
- B vitamin supplementation slowed cognitive decline only in participants with adequate omega-3 status, supporting a nutrient synergy model [Oulhaj et al. 2016](/docs/papers/BRAIN-Diet-References#oulhaj_omega-3_2016)
- Elevated plasma homocysteine is frequently elevated in ADHD and other neurodegenerative disorders [Yu et al. 2020](/docs/papers/BRAIN-Diet-References#yu_plasma_2020)
- Homocysteine is implicated in the induction of oxidative stress, modulation of oxygen levels, and initiation of lipid peroxidation pathway [Lukovac et al. 2024](/docs/papers/BRAIN-Diet-References#lukovac_homocysteine_2024)
- MTHFR polymorphisms reduce the efficiency of folate cycling and methylation, increasing susceptibility to cognitive dysfunction and ADHD-related symptoms
- Research indicates that deficiencies in vitamins and minerals essential for methylation, such as folate, vitamin B12, and zinc, are correlated to ADHD symptoms [Razavinia et al. 2024](/docs/papers/BRAIN-Diet-References#razavinia_effect_2024)
- Dietary patterns rich in fibre, folate, and omega-3 fatty acids were associated with reduced ADHD symptoms [Millichap and Yee 2012](/docs/papers/BRAIN-Diet-References#millichap_diet_2012)
- Isoquercetin bioavailability is improved by simultaneous ingestion with vitamin C, folate, and additional flavonoids [Y. Li et al. 2016](/docs/papers/BRAIN-Diet-References#li_quercetin_2016)
