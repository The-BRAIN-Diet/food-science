# Nutrients for Brain Health

This section provides detailed information about key nutrients that are essential for brain health and play important roles in the BRAIN diet. Each nutrient is discussed in terms of its role in brain function, relationship to ADHD and cognitive health, dietary sources, and integration with the BRAIN diet framework.

## Micronutrients

### Essential Minerals and Elements

<TagList tag="Mineral" />

### Essential Vitamins

<TagList tag="Vitamin" />

## Key Concepts

### Nutrient Synergy

Many nutrients work together to support brain health. For example:

- **Iron + Vitamin C**: Enhanced absorption of non-heme iron
- **Magnesium + Vitamin D**: Improved behavioral outcomes
- **Zinc + Magnesium**: Comprehensive neurotransmitter support

### Bioavailability

The BRAIN diet emphasizes:

- **Food preparation methods** that improve nutrient absorption
- **Strategic food combinations** that enhance bioavailability
- **Reduction of antinutrients** through soaking, sprouting, and fermentation

### Individual Variation

Nutrient needs vary based on:

- **Genetic factors** (e.g., MTHFR polymorphisms)
- **Health status** and medical conditions
- **Dietary preferences** (vegetarian/vegan vs. omnivore)
- **Age and life stage**

## Integration with BRAIN Diet

The BRAIN diet framework addresses nutrient needs through:

- **Whole food focus** for optimal nutrient density
- **Strategic food combinations** for enhanced absorption
- **Preparation techniques** that preserve and improve nutrient availability
- **Flexible approach** that accommodates different dietary preferences

## Notes

This nutrient information is based on the comprehensive review presented in the BRAIN diet paper. Each nutrient page includes specific details about its role in brain health, research evidence, dietary considerations, and practical integration strategies.
