## Overview

Lycopene is a carotenoid found primarily in tomatoes. Like other carotenoids, it plays a neuroprotective role through its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Lycopene is a fat-soluble pigment that accumulates selectively in neural tissues, where it helps scavenge reactive oxygen species and stabilize cell membranes. The bioaccessibility of lycopene in tomatoes is very low—less than 1% in both canned and fresh tomatoes. Prolonged cooking increases access to lycopene by breaking down cell walls, and co-consuming a small amount of unsaturated fat improves micelle formation and chylomicron packaging, increasing absorption.
