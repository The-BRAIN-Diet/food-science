## Overview

Lycopene is a carotenoid found primarily in tomatoes. Like other carotenoids, it plays a neuroprotective role through its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Lycopene is a fat-soluble pigment that accumulates selectively in neural tissues, where it helps scavenge reactive oxygen species and stabilize cell membranes.

## From the paper

- The bioaccessibility of carotenoids in vegetables is remarkably low—lycopene in canned and fresh tomatoes is &lt;1%.
- Prolonged cooking increases access to lycopene in tomatoes where cell walls need to be broken down.
- Carotenoids are abundant in leafy greens, orange and yellow vegetables, corn, and egg yolks. Their absorption is enhanced by dietary fat.
- Co-consuming a small amount of unsaturated fat with polyphenol-rich foods improves micelle formation and chylomicron packaging, increasing carotenoid and fat-soluble vitamin absorption.

## Practical notes

- Sources: tomatoes (especially cooked), watermelon, pink grapefruit, papaya
- Bioaccessibility is very low in fresh tomatoes (&lt;1%)
- Prolonged cooking increases lycopene availability by breaking down cell walls
- Absorption is enhanced by dietary fat
- Practical pairings: tomatoes + olive oil, cooked tomato sauces with healthy fats
