## Overview

L-theanine is an amino acid found in green tea that promotes relaxed alertness and may aid sleep initiation when timed appropriately. It increases alpha brain waves, creating a calming effect without sedation, making it valuable for evening wind-down and sleep preparation. L-theanine synergizes with magnesium and tryptophan strategies for circadian alignment and supports GABAergic tone and neurotransmitter balance.
