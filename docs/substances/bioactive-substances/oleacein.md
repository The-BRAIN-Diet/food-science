## Overview

Oleacein is a secoiridoid polyphenol found in extra-virgin olive oil, particularly in early harvest oils. It acts as a potent antioxidant and activates the NRF2 pathway, which regulates cellular antioxidant defenses. Oleacein is one of the key bioactive compounds that contribute to the brain health benefits of extra-virgin olive oil through antioxidant mechanisms.
