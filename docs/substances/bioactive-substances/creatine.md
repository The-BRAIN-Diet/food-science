## Overview

Creatine buffers ATP via the phosphocreatine system, supporting high energy demand in neurons. It may benefit cognitive performance under load and synergize with mitochondrial supports.

## From the paper

- “Supports ATP recycling in neurons; improves cognitive performance in sleep‑deprived adults; additive neuroprotection with CoQ10 in neurodegenerative models.”

## Practical notes

- Sources: beef, lamb, pork, fish; minimal in plant foods. Consider supplementation for vegan diets or high cognitive load contexts.
