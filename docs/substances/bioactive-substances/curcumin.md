## Overview

Curcumin is the primary bioactive compound in turmeric, supporting neuroprotection and anti-inflammatory pathways. Systematic reviews affirm that curcumin supplementation can improve memory performance in older adults and enhance overall cognitive function in both healthy and at-risk populations. Curcumin's benefits may depend on bioavailability, which is markedly improved by pairing with piperine and fats. Turmeric, along with omega-3s and other polyphenols, contributes to BDNF expression through exercise and polyphenol synergy, with anti-inflammatory diets helping sustain BDNF levels.
