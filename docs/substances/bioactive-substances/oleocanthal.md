## Overview

Oleocanthal is a secoiridoid polyphenol found in extra-virgin olive oil, particularly in early harvest oils. It exhibits strong anti-inflammatory effects through NF-κB inhibition, with activity similar to ibuprofen. Oleocanthal is one of the key bioactive compounds that contribute to the brain health benefits of extra-virgin olive oil, working synergistically with other olive oil polyphenols.
