mechanisms:
  Gut Microbiome: Suppresses SIBO, Candida, and pathobionts; reduces LPS translocation; increases nutrient absorption (B12, iron, tryptophan); increases SCFA resilience
  Insulin Response: Improves insulin sensitivity; limits sympathetic activation
  Inflammation: Reduces LPS translocation and dampens LPS-driven inflammation through antimicrobial effects on pathobionts

## Overview

Berberine is a polyphenolic alkaloid that supports glycemic control, has antimicrobial effects, and modulates the microbiome. It is part of glucose regulation strategies and SIBO suppression protocols. **Note:** Berberine is typically consumed as a supplement (from plants like barberry, goldenseal, or Oregon grape) rather than from common dietary foods in meaningful amounts, which is why no foods are listed below.
