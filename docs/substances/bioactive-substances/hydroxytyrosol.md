## Overview

Hydroxytyrosol is a potent antioxidant polyphenol found in extra-virgin olive oil, particularly in early harvest oils with higher polyphenol levels. It contributes to the strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory profile of extra-virgin olive oil, supporting neuroprotective effects. Early harvest extra-virgin olive oil contains higher levels of hydroxytyrosol, oleuropein, and other polyphenols, making it a valuable component of the BRAIN Diet's precision dietary strategies.
