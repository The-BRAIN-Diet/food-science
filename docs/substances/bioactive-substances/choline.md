## Overview

Choline supports acetylcholine synthesis, methylation (via betaine/TMG), and membrane phospholipid biosynthesis (PC). Adequate choline underpins neurotransmission, membrane fluidity, and homocysteine recycling.

## Biological Roles

### Acetylcholine Synthesis

**Acetylcholine and choline:** Memory, learning, neuroplasticity. Cofactors: **Choline**, acetyl-CoA. Food sources: Egg yolks, fish roe, soy, wheat germ, liver. Regular choline intake supports ongoing synthesis; important for structural membrane health (paper.txt, line 351).

Choline, while not an amino-acid, is commonly found in protein-rich foods and plays a crucial role in **acetylcholine synthesis** and membrane integrity in neurons. Choline has had a positive effect on ADHD in studies (Derbyshire and Maes 2023). There are recent studies now targeting imbalances in the cholinergic systems representing a new focus in ADHD etiology (Johansson et al. 2013) (paper.txt, line 384).

Lactobacillus was shown to product **acetycholine** in a study dating back to 1947 (Stephenson et al. 1947) and such strains have also been shown to be effective against Alzheimer's disease induced rat models (Nimgampalle 2017) (paper.txt, line 532).

### Phosphatidylcholine and Membrane Health

**Choline and PC support methylation and BBB transport of DHA via LPC forms** (paper.txt, line 14).

Phosphatidylcholine (PC) a key carrier of DHA and EPA. DHA or EPA incorporated into PC and converted into lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) crosses the blood-brain barrier (BBB) far more efficiently than its free fatty acid or triglyceride-bound forms (Patrick 2019) (paper.txt, line 454).

Vegans should ensure adequate **choline** intake (e.g., soy or sunflower lecithin, soy foods, quinoa, broccoli) to support **phosphatidylcholine synthesis** and downstream LPC-DHA transport for brain delivery (see Section 3.1) (paper.txt, line 259).

Phospholipid methylation (PLM), a process enhanced by dopamine D4 receptor activity, a key gene implicated in ADHD (Martel et al. 2011), alters the structure of membranes, facilitating faster neuronal recovery while influencing ion channel behavior in the generation of gamma oscillations, brainwaves linked to attention and cognition. Abnormalities in membrane composition and PLM have been linked to impaired ion channel regulation and reduced gamma-band activity in ADHD (Cocchi et al. 2017) (Wilson et al. 2012). Phospholipid methylation, dependent on SAMe (see methylation Section 3.2), directly affects membrane fluidity and neurotransmitter receptor function. Maintaining optimal intake of phospholipid precursors, **choline**, methionine, and serine, may support PLM and cognitive performance (paper.txt, line 465).

### Methylation Support

Trimethylglycine (TMG), also known as betaine, is a dietary methyl donor that helps recycle Hcy to methionine via an alternative pathway. **Choline**, a precursor to both TMG and phosphatidylcholine (PC), is similarly involved in homocysteine clearance and, as discussed above, membrane phospholipid biosynthesis. These pathways are vulnerable to genetic variants such as MTHFR polymorphisms, which reduce the efficiency of folate cycling and methylation, thereby increasing susceptibility to cognitive dysfunction and ADHD-related symptoms (paper.txt, line 483).

Dietary patterns can modulate gene expression and epigenetic regulation through multiple pathways, although the strength of evidence varies by gene. For example, nutrients involved in one-carbon metabolism (e.g., folate, riboflavin, B12, **choline**) can influence methylation dynamics relevant to MTHFR and COMT activity (paper.txt, line 484).

### Endocannabinoid System Support

The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is a key neuromodulatory system that helps regulate dopamine signaling (Covey et al. 2017) and motivation (Laksmidewi and Soejitno 2021), stress response, and inflammation, processes that are often disrupted in ADHD and other neurodevelopmental conditions. A major pathway supporting this system is the CDP-ethanolamine pathway, which produces phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)—a key brain phospholipid and potential ADHD biomarker. PE can be converted into **phosphatidylcholine (PC)** or N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamines (NAPEs) (Garani, Watts, and Mizrahi 2021) (paper.txt, line 467).

Supporting NAPEs production through diet via PE-rich foods like eggs, fish roe, and liver may enhance ECS tone. Clinical trials have shown a doubling of plasma levels after dietary increases in oat bran due to it's rich PE content (Sean Davies 2018) (paper.txt, line 468).

### Adenosine Regulation

Adenosine, an endogenous somnogen that accumulates during wakefulness, is a critical regulator of dopamine signaling, sleep homeostasis, inflammation, and neural plasticity. Emerging evidence suggests that specific dietary compounds, such as green tea polyphenols, and adenosine-regulating nutrients including plant-based methyl donors (folate, **choline**, betaine), may influence adenosine metabolism, modulate HPA axis activity, and help restore neurotransmitter balance ((Md. Jakaria a, n.d.) (Jia et al. 2024) (paper.txt, line 813).

Specific Nutrient Modulators: Taurine; adenosine-regulating nutrients (green tea polyphenols, folate, **choline**, betaine) - HPA buffering, cortisol reduction, dopamine signaling, sleep pressure, neurotransmitter balance (paper.txt, line 799).

## Vegan Considerations

Vegan versions of the protocol must address key nutrients that are rarely adequate through vegan whole foods alone. These include vitamin B12, DHA/EPA, **choline**, taurine, carnosine, creatine, and bioavailable iron and zinc (paper.txt, line 258).

Precision sourcing of functional plant foods such as Mankai duckweed (iron, B12), **soy/soy lecithin (choline)**, and fortified nutritional yeast (B12, B6) helps narrow vegan nutrient gaps. Microalgae provide DHA, typically in triglyceride form; vegans should ensure adequate **choline** intake (e.g., soy or sunflower lecithin, soy foods, quinoa, broccoli) to support phosphatidylcholine synthesis and downstream LPC-DHA transport for brain delivery (see Section 3.1) (paper.txt, line 259).

## Practical Notes

- **Egg yolks and fish roe** are highest sources
- **Soy lecithin and sunflower lecithin** provide concentrated choline for vegans
- **Pair with DHA** for membrane and neurochemical support (LPC-DHA transport)
- **Choline status influences TMG/betaine pathways** for methylation
