## Overview

Choline supports acetylcholine synthesis, methylation (via betaine/TMG), and membrane phospholipid biosynthesis (PC). Adequate choline underpins neurotransmission, membrane fluidity, and homocysteine recycling.

## From the paper

- “Choline… plays a crucial role in acetylcholine synthesis and membrane integrity… Choline and PC support methylation and BBB transport of DHA via LPC forms.”

## Practical notes

- Sources: egg yolks, fish roe, soy/lecithin, liver, wheat germ. Pair with DHA for membrane and neurochemical support; choline status influences TMG/betaine pathways.
