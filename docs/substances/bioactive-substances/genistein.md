mechanisms:
  Endocannabinoid System: Inhibits fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), preserving anandamide levels and enhancing ECS tone; modulates dopamine, glutamate, and GABA signaling
  Inflammation: Anti-inflammatory and anti-neuroinflammatory properties; reduces neuroinflammation
  Oxidative Stress: Prevents neuronal death; increases hippocampal glutathione (GSH) and superoxide dismutase (SOD); lowers lipid peroxidation, ROS, and nitric oxide production
  Neurochemical Balance: Enhances endocannabinoid activity; modulates dopamine, glutamate, and GABA signaling pathways

- Polyphenols such as genistein may further enhance ECS tone by inhibiting fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), the enzyme responsible for anandamide degradation [Gibellini and Smith 2010](/docs/papers/BRAIN-Diet-References#gibellini_kennedy_2010)
- Genistein may amplify the ECS's ability to regulate dopamine, glutamate, and GABA signaling, all key pathways to regulate in ADHD
- Genistein has been confirmed to alleviate the deleterious effects of oxidative stress on neuronal injury, preventing neuronal death, increasing hippocampal glutathione and superoxide dismutase production, and lowering lipid peroxidation and reactive oxygen species [Fuloria et al. 2022](/docs/papers/BRAIN-Diet-References#fuloria_genistein_2022)
- Genistein is believed to pass the blood–brain barrier and is extensively applied in the investigation of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Huntington's [Fuloria et al. 2022](/docs/papers/BRAIN-Diet-References#fuloria_genistein_2022)
