## Overview

Zeaxanthin is a carotenoid that plays a neuroprotective role through its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. This fat-soluble pigment accumulates selectively in neural tissues, including the retina and brain, where it helps scavenge reactive oxygen species and stabilize cell membranes.

## From the paper

- Carotenoids, particularly lutein, zeaxanthin, and β-carotene, play a neuroprotective role through their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. These fat-soluble pigments accumulate selectively in neural tissues, including the retina and brain, where they help scavenge reactive oxygen species and stabilize cell membranes.
- Lutein and zeaxanthin have been associated with improved cognitive performance, especially in domains such as memory, processing speed, and visual-spatial function.
- Carotenoids are abundant in leafy greens, orange and yellow vegetables, corn, and egg yolks. Their absorption is enhanced by dietary fat.

## Practical notes

- Sources: leafy greens, orange and yellow vegetables, corn, egg yolks
- Absorption is enhanced by dietary fat
- Co-consuming a small amount of unsaturated fat with carotenoid-rich foods improves micelle formation and chylomicron packaging, increasing carotenoid absorption
- Practical pairings: spinach + eggs, carrots + tahini, kale + avocado
