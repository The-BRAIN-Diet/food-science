mechanisms:
  Gut Microbiome: Green tea catechins increase Faecalibacterium and Roseburia; inhibit Enterobacteriaceae; reduce NF-κB activation
  Inflammation: Polyphenol antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects; reduces inflammatory signaling
  Oxidative Stress: Supports antioxidant defenses; part of antioxidant network
  Hormonal Response: Supports HPA axis regulation and stress response
  Stress Response: Contributes to stress buffering through polyphenol effects
