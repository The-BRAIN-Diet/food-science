mechanisms:
  Mitochondrial Support: Electron transport chain cofactor; supports ATP production; antioxidant protection for neurons
  Oxidative Stress: Part of antioxidant network; works synergistically with vitamin E, vitamin C, lipoic acid, and glutathione

- CoQ10 deficiency leads to reduced ATP production and mitochondrial dysfunction, which may contribute to neurocognitive issues in ADHD [Mantle and Hargreaves 2024](/docs/papers/BRAIN-Diet-References#mantle_efficacy_2024)
- CoQ10 levels decline dramatically with age, with over 50% depletion between 20 and 60 years of life
- Organ meats are the highest dietary source of CoQ10 (up to 12mg per 100g), while olive oil contains lower amounts (0.06-2mg per 100g) with great variation between producers and harvest times [Zmitek, Rodríguez-Aguilera, and Pravst 2014](/docs/papers/BRAIN-Diet-References#zmitek_factors_2014)

- CoQ10 is part of the antioxidant network, working synergistically with vitamin E, vitamin C, lipoic acid, and glutathione [Packer et al. 1997](/docs/papers/BRAIN-Diet-References#packer_antioxidant_1997)
