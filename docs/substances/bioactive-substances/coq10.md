## Overview

CoQ10 supports electron transport (ETC) and acts as an antioxidant in membranes. Levels decline with age; insufficiency impairs ATP production and increases oxidative stress burden relevant to cognitive function.

## From the paper

- “CoQ10 deficiency leads to reduced ATP production and mitochondrial dysfunction… organ meats are highest sources; olive oil contains low amounts with large variability… additive neuroprotection with creatine in models of Parkinson’s/Huntington’s.”

## Practical notes

- Sources: organ meats (heart, liver), oily fish; lower amounts in some plant foods and olive oil. Consider synergy with creatine and B‑vitamins; storage and producer variability affect levels.
