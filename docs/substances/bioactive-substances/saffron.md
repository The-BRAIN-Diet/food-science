## Overview

Saffron extracts show promise for mood and cognition; bioactives are heat/light sensitive—culinary use preferred; standardized extracts studied around 30 mg/day.

## From the paper

- Saffron is thought to boost serotonin and has antioxidant crocin; it has shown promising effects on depression, mood, cognition, and ADHD symptoms at doses around 30 mg/day of standardized extract.
- The delicate oils contained in saffron such as safranal and other volatile monoterpenes are highly sensitive to heat, light, and oxidation.
- Bloom gently (≈50–70 °C) in a little warm water or fat, and add near the end of cooking to preserve their aroma and bioactive potency.

## Practical notes

- Standardized extracts studied around 30 mg/day
- Bioactives are heat/light sensitive—culinary use preferred
- Bloom gently (≈50–70 °C) in warm water or fat, add near end of cooking to preserve terpene content
