## Overview

β-Carotene is a carotenoid that plays a neuroprotective role through its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. As both an antioxidant and vitamin A precursor, β-carotene supports immune regulation and neuronal development. This fat-soluble pigment accumulates selectively in neural tissues, where it helps scavenge reactive oxygen species and stabilize cell membranes.

## From the paper

- Carotenoids, particularly lutein, zeaxanthin, and β-carotene, play a neuroprotective role through their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. These fat-soluble pigments accumulate selectively in neural tissues, including the retina and brain, where they help scavenge reactive oxygen species and stabilize cell membranes.
- β-carotene, as both an antioxidant and vitamin A precursor, also supports immune regulation and neuronal development.
- The bioaccessibility of carotenoids in vegetables is remarkably low—only 1-3% of the β-carotene in raw carrots is accessible for absorption.
- Carotenoids are abundant in leafy greens, orange and yellow vegetables, corn, and egg yolks. Their absorption is enhanced by dietary fat.

## Practical notes

- Sources: leafy greens, orange and yellow vegetables (especially carrots), corn, egg yolks
- Bioaccessibility is low in raw vegetables (1-3% in raw carrots)
- Absorption is enhanced by dietary fat
- Co-consuming a small amount of unsaturated fat with carotenoid-rich foods improves micelle formation and chylomicron packaging, increasing carotenoid absorption
- Practical pairings: carrots + tahini, spinach + eggs, kale + avocado
