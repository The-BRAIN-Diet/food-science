mechanisms:
  Mitochondrial Support: Protects mitochondrial function under oxidative stress; stabilizes mitochondrial membranes; supports ATP production
  Hormonal Response: Exhibits adaptogenic properties by buffering the brain against chronic stress and regulating the HPA axis, including reductions in cortisol
  Stress Response: Buffers HPA axis dysregulation; reduces cortisol; supports stress resilience
  Neurochemical Balance: Modulates calcium handling; influences GABAergic tone; supports neurotransmitter balance

- Taurine modulates calcium signaling, antioxidant defense, and neurotransmission; brain taurine levels are tied to neuroprotection
- In animal models of ADHD, taurine supplementation has been linked to improvements in attention and hyperactivity, though equivalent human data are lacking
- While humans can synthesize small amounts of taurine endogenously from the precursor cysteine, this capacity is limited, making dietary intake from meats, shellfish, and cysteine-rich foods important [Wójcik et al. 2010](/docs/papers/BRAIN-Diet-References#wojcik_potential_2010)
