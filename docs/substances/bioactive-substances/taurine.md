## Overview

Taurine modulates calcium handling, supports mitochondrial membranes, and influences GABAergic tone and inflammation, with emerging relevance to stress buffering and cognition.

## From the paper

- “Taurine protects mitochondrial function under oxidative stress and modulates neuroinflammation; exhibits adaptogenic properties via HPA axis buffering; limited human ADHD data.”

## Practical notes

- Sources: seafood, dark‑meat poultry. Endogenous synthesis is limited; intake varies by diet pattern.
