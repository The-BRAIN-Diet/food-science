## Overview

Polysaccharides are complex carbohydrates found in medicinal mushrooms and other plant foods that have been extensively studied for their immune-modulating and gut microbiome supporting properties. In medicinal mushrooms, polysaccharides such as those found in Reishi, Turkey Tail, Lion's Mane, and Cordyceps act as prebiotics, supporting beneficial gut bacteria and enhancing microbial diversity. These compounds may help modulate immune responses, support gut barrier integrity, and contribute to the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) through microbial fermentation. Polysaccharides are one of the primary bioactive compounds responsible for the health benefits attributed to medicinal mushrooms.
