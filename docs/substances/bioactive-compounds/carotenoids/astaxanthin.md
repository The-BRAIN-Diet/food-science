## Overview

Astaxanthin is a lipid-soluble carotenoid pigment responsible for the bright orange-red color found in salmon, salmon roe, shrimp, lobster, and certain algae. It is one of the most powerful carotenoid antioxidants, with significantly greater antioxidant capacity than other carotenoids. Astaxanthin contributes to the stability of omega-3–rich membranes, helping to limit oxidative stress associated with highly unsaturated fats like DHA and EPA. In food matrices such as salmon roe, astaxanthin plays a crucial role in protecting these delicate lipids from oxidation while supporting mitochondrial and cellular resilience. Unlike many other antioxidants, astaxanthin can span cell membranes, providing protection to both the inner and outer layers of the membrane.
