## Overview

L-theanine is a unique amino acid found primarily in tea leaves, particularly green tea. It promotes a state of calm alertness by increasing alpha brain waves, which are associated with relaxed but focused mental states. L-theanine supports stress response modulation and contributes to HPA axis buffering, helping the body manage stress more effectively. It also supports GABAergic tone and neurotransmitter balance, making it useful for promoting relaxation and supporting sleep preparation when combined with other calming nutrients.
