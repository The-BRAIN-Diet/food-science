## Overview

L-DOPA (levodopa) is a direct precursor to dopamine that bypasses the rate-limiting tyrosine hydroxylase step in dopamine synthesis. Unlike tyrosine, which requires conversion through multiple enzymatic steps, L-DOPA can be directly converted to dopamine via aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), making it a more direct pathway to support dopamine availability. L-DOPA is naturally found in mucuna beans (Mucuna pruriens) and is used therapeutically in Parkinson's disease. In the context of the BRAIN Diet, mucuna beans provide a natural source of L-DOPA to support dopamine synthesis pathways, which are critical for attention, motivation, and executive function.
