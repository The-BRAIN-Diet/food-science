mechanisms:
  Gut Microbiome: Act as prebiotics supporting beneficial gut bacteria; enhance microbial diversity; support SCFA production; modulate gut barrier integrity
  Inflammation: Immune-modulating properties; may help reduce inflammatory responses; support immune cell function; specific beta-glucans like lentinan (Shiitake) and D-fraction (Maitake) have been extensively studied for immune support

## Overview

Beta-glucans are a type of polysaccharide found in mushrooms, oats, barley, and other foods that have been extensively researched for their immune-modulating properties. In medicinal mushrooms, beta-glucans such as lentinan in Shiitake and the D-fraction in Maitake have shown immune-modulating effects in research. Beta-glucans act as prebiotics, supporting beneficial gut bacteria and enhancing microbial diversity, which contributes to gut barrier integrity and the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). These compounds may help modulate immune responses and support immune cell function, making them valuable components of foods that support both gut health and immune function.
