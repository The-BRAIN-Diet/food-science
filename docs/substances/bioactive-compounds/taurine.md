mechanisms:
  Mitochondrial Support: Protects mitochondrial function under oxidative stress; stabilizes mitochondrial membranes; supports ATP production
  Hormonal Response: Exhibits adaptogenic properties by buffering the brain against chronic stress and regulating the HPA axis, including reductions in cortisol
  Stress Response: Buffers HPA axis dysregulation; reduces cortisol; supports stress resilience
  Neurochemical Balance: Modulates calcium handling; influences GABAergic tone; supports neurotransmitter balance

## Overview

Taurine is a sulfur-containing amino acid that plays multiple important roles in brain health and function. It functions as an osmoregulator, helping maintain proper fluid balance in cells, and stabilizes mitochondrial membranes, supporting energy production. Taurine exhibits adaptogenic properties by helping buffer the brain against chronic stress and regulating the HPA axis, including reducing cortisol levels. It also modulates calcium signaling, supports GABAergic tone, and contributes to antioxidant defense and neurotransmission. While the body can synthesize some taurine, dietary intake from animal sources is important for optimal levels.
