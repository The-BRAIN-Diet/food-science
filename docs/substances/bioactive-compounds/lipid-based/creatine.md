## Overview

Creatine is a nitrogen-containing compound that plays a critical role in cellular energy metabolism, particularly in tissues with high energy demands like the brain and muscles. It functions through the phosphocreatine system, which acts as a rapid energy buffer to recycle ATP, the primary energy currency of cells. In the brain, creatine helps support high-energy demand processes such as neurotransmitter synthesis, ion pumping, and synaptic transmission. It enhances mitochondrial energy buffering and supports cognitive function, particularly under conditions of increased cognitive load or energy stress.
