## Overview

Saffron is a spice derived from the Crocus sativus flower, containing bioactive compounds including crocin and safranal. It is thought to support mood regulation through effects on serotonin signaling and exhibits antioxidant properties through its crocin content. Saffron's delicate volatile oils, particularly safranal, are highly sensitive to heat, light, and oxidation, requiring careful preparation to preserve their bioactive potency. While saffron has a distinct flavor that limits its culinary uses, it represents a valuable bioactive compound for supporting mood, cognition, and overall brain health.
