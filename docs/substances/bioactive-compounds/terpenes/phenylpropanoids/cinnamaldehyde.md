## Overview

Cinnamaldehyde is the primary aromatic compound in cinnamon, accounting for 60-80% of cinnamon essential oils. It is the key bioactive compound responsible for cinnamon's characteristic flavor and many of its health benefits, particularly its effects on glycemic control and insulin sensitivity. Cinnamaldehyde works synergistically with other cinnamon polyphenols, including procyanidins, to support glucose regulation and metabolic health.
