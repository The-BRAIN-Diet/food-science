mechanisms:
  Gut Microbiome: Green tea catechins increase Faecalibacterium and Roseburia; inhibit Enterobacteriaceae; reduce NF-κB activation
  Inflammation: Polyphenol antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects; reduces inflammatory signaling
  Oxidative Stress: Supports antioxidant defenses; part of antioxidant network
  Hormonal Response: Supports HPA axis regulation and stress response
  Stress Response: Contributes to stress buffering through polyphenol effects

## Overview

EGCG (epigallocatechin gallate) is the most abundant and biologically active catechin polyphenol in green tea. It supports gut barrier integrity, modulates the microbiome by promoting beneficial bacteria and inhibiting harmful ones, and contributes to anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. EGCG works synergistically with other green tea polyphenols and dietary components to support brain health, glucose regulation, and overall metabolic function.
