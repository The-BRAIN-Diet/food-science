## Overview

Quercetin is a flavonoid polyphenol found in many plant foods including onions, capers, apples, and berries. It exhibits strong antioxidant properties, effectively scavenging reactive oxygen species and supporting antioxidant defenses. Quercetin also has anti-inflammatory, anti-neuroinflammatory, and neuroprotective properties, supporting gut barrier integrity and helping suppress inflammatory signaling. It enhances mitochondrial baseline activity and energy production, supporting mitochondrial function. The bioavailability of quercetin is improved when consumed with vitamin C, folate, and other flavonoids, and isoquercetin (the glycosylated form) is more completely absorbed than the aglycone form.
