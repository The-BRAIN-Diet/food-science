## Overview

Hydroxytyrosol is a potent phenolic antioxidant found in extra-virgin olive oil, particularly in early harvest oils. It is one of the most powerful natural antioxidants and exhibits strong anti-inflammatory properties. Hydroxytyrosol is derived from oleuropein and tyrosol through enzymatic processes and contributes significantly to the brain health benefits of extra-virgin olive oil. It works synergistically with other olive oil polyphenols, including oleuropein, oleocanthal, and oleacein, to support neuroprotective effects, mitochondrial function, and overall antioxidant defenses.
