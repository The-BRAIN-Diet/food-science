mechanisms:
  Endocannabinoid System: Precursor for phosphatidylcholine (PC) synthesis; PE can be converted into PC or N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamines (NAPEs); NAPEs are precursors to N-acyl ethanolamines (NAEs) like palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), oleoylethanolamide (OEA), and anandamide (AEA), bioactive lipids which act as neuromodulators with anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, and mood-regulating effects
  Methylation: Precursor to trimethylglycine (TMG/betaine), a dietary methyl donor that helps recycle homocysteine to methionine via an alternative pathway; supports one-carbon metabolism alongside folate, riboflavin, and B12; influences methylation dynamics relevant to MTHFR and COMT activity
  Neurochemical Balance: Essential precursor for acetylcholine synthesis, supporting memory, learning, and neuroplasticity; supports membrane phospholipid biosynthesis (PC) which is critical for membrane fluidity and neurotransmitter receptor function; phospholipid methylation (PLM) alters membrane structure, facilitating faster neuronal recovery and influencing ion channel behavior in gamma oscillations linked to attention and cognition

## Overview

Choline is an essential nutrient that serves multiple critical functions in brain health. It is a precursor for acetylcholine, a key neurotransmitter involved in memory, learning, and attention. Choline also functions as a methyl donor through its conversion to betaine, supporting one-carbon metabolism and methylation processes. Additionally, choline is essential for the synthesis of phospholipids, particularly phosphatidylcholine, which are crucial for cell membrane structure and function, neurotransmitter receptor activity, and the production of endocannabinoid system signaling molecules.
