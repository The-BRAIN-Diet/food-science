mechanisms:
  Gut Microbiome: Byproduct of fibre fermentation; supports intestinal barrier integrity; regulates immune responses
  Inflammation: Helps reduce neuroinflammation and protects the blood-brain barrier; enhances cognitive function
  Insulin Response: Improves insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism; helps stabilize blood glucose and reduce insulin resistance
  Neurochemical Balance: Stimulates secretion of norepinephrine and may influence dopamine regulation; promotes synthesis of key neurotransmitters

## Overview

Propionate is a short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) produced by gut bacteria through fermentation of dietary fiber. It plays important roles in reducing neuroinflammation, protecting the blood-brain barrier, and regulating neurotransmitter secretion. Propionate stimulates norepinephrine secretion and may influence dopamine regulation, making it important for neurochemical balance. ADHD groups have been shown to exhibit significantly lower levels of propionic acid.
