mechanisms:
  Gut Microbiome: Byproduct of fibre fermentation; supports intestinal barrier integrity; regulates immune responses; promotes synthesis of key neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin
  Mitochondrial Support: Supports mitochondrial function, enhancing brain energy metabolism; aids in reducing cholesterol and neuroinflammation
  Inflammation: Has anti-inflammatory effects, potentially reducing neuroinflammation; deficiencies linked to many neurological disorders including ADHD
  Insulin Response: Improves insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism; helps stabilize blood glucose and reduce insulin resistance
  Oxidative Stress: Enhances mitochondrial function during oxidative stress; supports antioxidant activity

## Overview

Butyrate is a key short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) produced by gut bacteria through fermentation of dietary fiber. It is one of the most important SCFAs for brain health, as it can cross the blood-brain barrier and directly support mitochondrial function. Butyrate deficiencies have been linked to many neurological disorders including ADHD, and it plays crucial roles in maintaining gut barrier integrity, reducing neuroinflammation, and supporting neurotransmitter synthesis.
