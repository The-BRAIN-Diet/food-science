## Overview

Acetate is the most abundant short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) produced by gut bacteria through fermentation of dietary fiber. It is the simplest SCFA and serves as a building block for other SCFAs. Acetate plays important roles in supporting intestinal barrier integrity, regulating immune responses, and promoting synthesis of key neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin. ADHD groups have been shown to exhibit significantly lower levels of acetic acid.
