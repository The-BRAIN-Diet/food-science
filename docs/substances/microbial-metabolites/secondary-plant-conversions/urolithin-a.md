mechanisms:
  Gut Microbiome: Produced from ellagitannins by gut bacteria; production varies by individual gut microbiome composition, particularly Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio; higher polyphenol intake and microbial diversity increase urolithin A production
  Mitochondrial Support: Supports mitochondrial resilience and mitophagy; improves cognitive endurance; may extend to executive function
  Inflammation: Powerful antioxidant; supports anti-inflammatory effects
  Oxidative Stress: Powerful antioxidant; supports antioxidant defenses
