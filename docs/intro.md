# Welcome to the BRAIN Diet

The BRAIN Diet (Bio-Regulation Algorithm and Integrated Neuronutrition) is a comprehensive, evidence-based approach to supporting brain health through precision nutrition.

## What is the BRAIN Diet?

The BRAIN Diet is a Mediterranean-rooted precision nutrition model designed to optimize brain health through integrated nutritional strategies. It targets the key biological systems commonly disrupted in ADHD, depression, cognitive decline, and other neurocognitive disorders.

## Areas

<TagList tag="Area" />

## Key Features

- **Plant-based leaning** (70% minimum energy from plants)
- **Food-first approach** with no-supplement baseline
- **Targeted micronutrient density**
- **Neurotransmitter precursor support**
- **Circadian-aligned meal timing**
- **Food matrix strategies** for nutrient synergy
- **Psychobiotic and polyphenol-rich foods**

## Getting Started

1. **Read the [Nutrients Overview](./nutrients/)**: Understand the key nutrients and their roles
2. **Explore individual nutrients**: Learn about specific vitamins and minerals
3. **Understand the framework**: See how the diet integrates multiple systems

## Who Can Benefit?

The BRAIN Diet is designed for:

- Individuals with ADHD and attention difficulties
- Those experiencing cognitive decline
- People with mood and anxiety disorders
- Anyone interested in optimizing brain health
- Both omnivore and plant-based eaters

## Scientific Foundation

This approach is based on comprehensive research into:

- Neurotransmitter regulation
- Mitochondrial function
- Gut-brain axis communication
- Inflammation and oxidative stress
- Methylation pathways
- Circadian rhythms and metabolism

## Getting Help

For questions about implementing the BRAIN Diet, consult with qualified healthcare professionals who can provide personalized guidance based on your individual health status and needs.
