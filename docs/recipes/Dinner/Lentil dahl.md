## Overview

This warming dahl combines turmeric (curcumin), ginger, high-fibre lentils, and folate-rich spinach. Lentils provide fibre that feeds gut bacteria; turmeric and ginger contain compounds studied for anti-inflammatory effects; spinach provides folate, a B vitamin involved in one-carbon metabolism.

## Ingredients

- 1 cup red lentils
- 1 tbsp grated fresh turmeric (or 1 tsp ground turmeric)
- 1 tsp grated ginger
- 1 tsp cumin
- 1 tbsp coconut oil
- 2 cups water or stock
- 1 cup spinach
- Salt & pepper to taste
- Optional: lemon juice, coriander

## Method

1. Rinse lentils thoroughly until the water runs clear.
2. Heat coconut oil in a pot over medium heat.
3. Add turmeric, ginger, and cumin; sauté for 1 minute until fragrant.
4. Add lentils and water (or stock).
5. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 15–20 minutes until soft and creamy.
6. Stir in spinach and cook until wilted.
7. Season with salt, pepper, and optional lemon juice.
8. Serve warm.

## Brain Health Notes

- **Turmeric** contains curcumin, a polyphenol studied for anti-inflammatory effects.
- **Ginger** contains gingerols studied for anti-inflammatory effects.
- **Lentils** provide high fibre that feeds gut bacteria; fibre fermentation produces SCFAs associated with gut health.
- **Spinach** supplies folate, a B vitamin involved in one-carbon metabolism.
