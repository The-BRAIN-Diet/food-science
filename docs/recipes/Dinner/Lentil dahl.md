## Overview

This warming, anti-inflammatory dahl combines turmeric's powerful curcumin with ginger's anti-inflammatory properties, high-fibre lentils for gut health, and folate-rich spinach. The combination provides strong NF-κB inhibition to reduce neuroinflammation, supports SCFA production through prebiotic fibre, and delivers essential nutrients for methylation pathways, making it an ideal evening meal for stable glucose and calmer energy.

## Ingredients

- 1 cup red lentils
- 1 tbsp grated fresh turmeric (or 1 tsp ground turmeric)
- 1 tsp grated ginger
- 1 tsp cumin
- 1 tbsp coconut oil
- 2 cups water or stock
- 1 cup spinach
- Salt & pepper to taste
- Optional: lemon juice, coriander

## Method

1. Rinse lentils thoroughly until the water runs clear.
2. Heat coconut oil in a pot over medium heat.
3. Add turmeric, ginger, and cumin; sauté for 1 minute until fragrant.
4. Add lentils and water (or stock).
5. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 15–20 minutes until soft and creamy.
6. Stir in spinach and cook until wilted.
7. Season with salt, pepper, and optional lemon juice.
8. Serve warm.
