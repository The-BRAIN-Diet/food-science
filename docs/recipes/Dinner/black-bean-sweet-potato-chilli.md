A hearty bean and vegetable chilli built around black beans, sweet potato, and mixed vegetables. This dish combines fibre, plant protein, and warming spices to support steady energy and satiety. Ideal for batch cooking and adaptable to different dietary preferences.

## Ingredients (4–6 servings)

**Base**
- 2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
- 1 small onion, finely diced
- 2 garlic cloves, minced

**Vegetables**
- 1 medium sweet potato, grated or finely diced
- 1 carrot, grated
- ½ courgette (zucchini), grated
- 1 red bell pepper, diced

**Protein & sauce**
- 2 × 400 g cans black beans, drained and rinsed
- 3 tbsp tomato purée
- 250 ml vegetable stock

**Spices**

## Method

1. Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and cook until softened, about 3–5 minutes.
2. Stir in garlic and cook briefly until fragrant.
3. Add sweet potato, carrot, courgette, and bell pepper. Cook for 3–5 minutes, stirring to combine.
4. Add black beans, tomato purée, stock, and spices. Stir well.
5. Bring to a gentle simmer, cover, and cook 30–40 minutes, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are tender and flavours develop.

Serve warm with optional yoghurt, herbs, lime, or whole grains.

## Extra Guidance

## Nutrition (approximate, per serving)

> Based on 4 servings.

- **Energy:** ~350–400 kcal
- **Protein:** ~10–12 g per serving (4 servings); black beans provide most of the plant protein (~8 g per 100 g cooked)
- **Carbohydrates:** ~55–65 g (from beans, sweet potato, vegetables)
- **Fat:** ~8–10 g
- **Fibre:** ~14–18 g

## Brain Health Notes

- **Black beans** are high in plant protein (~8 g per 100 g cooked) and provide fibre that feeds gut bacteria; fibre fermentation produces short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) associated with gut health. Beans also supply folate and minerals.
- **Sweet potato and carrots** provide beta-carotene and fibre studied for antioxidant and vascular effects.
- **Bell peppers and tomatoes** contribute vitamin C and carotenoids.
- **Extra virgin olive oil** contributes monounsaturated fats and polyphenols associated with cardiovascular and brain health.
- **Whole grains** (quinoa or brown rice) provide slow-digesting carbohydrates and fibre.
