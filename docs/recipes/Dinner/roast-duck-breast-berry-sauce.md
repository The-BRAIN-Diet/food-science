# Roast Duck Breast with Berry Sauce

<img src="/img/recipes/duck%20with%20saffron%20potatoes%20and%20aubergine.jpeg" alt="Roast duck breast with berry sauce, saffron potatoes and aubergine" width="480" />

## Overview

This recipe focuses on properly cooked duck breast paired with a bright berry sauce that balances richness with acidity and fruit depth. The method emphasises controlled fat rendering, clean slicing, and a lightly emulsified sauce rather than a heavy reduction. The result is a dish that feels indulgent yet structured, allowing the duck to remain the central element while the sauce provides contrast and lift.

It works particularly well when served with simple roasted vegetables or potatoes that absorb the duck juices and complement the sauce's acidity.

## Ingredients (serves 2)

### Duck
- 1 large duck breast (serves 2)
- salt

### Berry sauce
- 150 g blueberries
- 80 g raspberries
- 2 tbsp water or light stock
- 1–2 tsp balsamic vinegar
- small knob of butter
- pinch cinnamon or crushed juniper (optional)
- salt and black pepper

### Saffron oil finish
- pinch saffron threads
- 1–2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil

## Method

### 1. Prepare the duck
1. Score the duck skin lightly in a crosshatch pattern, avoiding the flesh.
2. Season well with salt.
3. Place skin-side down in a cold pan.
4. Cook gently over medium heat for **6–8 minutes**, allowing the fat to render slowly and the skin to crisp.
5. Turn and cook for **3–4 minutes** more depending on thickness.
6. Remove from pan and rest for at least **5 minutes** before slicing.

### 2. Make the berry sauce
1. Place blueberries and water in a small pan.
2. Heat gently for **3–4 minutes** until berries begin to burst.
3. Add raspberries and cook another **1–2 minutes**.
4. Lightly crush some fruit with a spoon.
5. Add balsamic vinegar and seasoning.
6. Remove from heat and whisk in the butter to emulsify.

Do not over-reduce — the sauce should remain bright and lightly textured.

### 3. Prepare saffron oil garnish
1. Crush saffron threads.
2. Stir into warm olive oil.
3. Leave to infuse for **at least 5 minutes**.

---

### 4. Assemble
1. Slice the duck breast.
2. Spoon the berry sauce neatly onto the plate.
3. Arrange duck slices beside the sauce.
4. Drizzle a small amount of saffron-infused olive oil lightly over the duck just before serving.

Use sparingly — this is an aromatic finish rather than a sauce.

## Serving Suggestions

Serve with:

- [Saffron Roast Potatoes](/docs/recipes/Side-dishes/Saffron-roast-potatoes)

- [Roasted Aubergine with Herb Olive Oil](/docs/recipes/Side-dishes/roasted-aubergine-herb-olive-oil)

These sides absorb the duck juices and complement the berry sauce's acidity while adding texture and colour to the plate.

## Notes

- Duck benefits from resting; slicing too early will release juices.
- The sauce should remain loose rather than syrupy.
- A light drizzle of saffron oil enhances aroma without overpowering the duck.
