## Overview

This dish applies a classic Italian emulsification technique to shellfish pasta, producing a glossy, integrated sauce without the use of cream. Cockles are briefly steamed to preserve their natural liquor, which contains amino acids, minerals, and marine peptides contributing to both flavour and nutritional value. The dish works equally well with [mussels](/docs/foods/mussels) or [clams](/docs/foods/clams), which have similar nutritional profiles; clams and mussels are even higher in taurine [Wójcik et al. 2009](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2813349/). Whole-wheat linguine provides a fibre-rich carbohydrate base, while onion, garlic, olive oil, and parsley create a balanced aromatic structure. The sauce is finished with egg yolk and cheese off heat, forming a stable emulsion that increases nutrient density while maintaining a light texture.

## Rationale (BRAIN Diet Context)

This recipe supports several core BRAIN Diet principles:

- Marine amino acids such as taurine contribute to neuronal stability and mitochondrial function.
- Shellfish provide highly bioavailable B12, iron, zinc, and selenium, which are relevant to neurotransmitter synthesis and energy metabolism.
- Whole-grain pasta moderates glucose release and provides fibre supporting gut-brain signalling.
- Olive oil supplies monounsaturated fats and polyphenols linked with vascular and anti-inflammatory pathways.
- Egg yolk contributes phospholipids, choline, and cholesterol, supporting membrane structure, acetylcholine pathways, and lipid-mediated nutrient absorption.

The result is a meal combining stable energy supply, micronutrient density, and flavour integrity.

## Ingredients (2 servings)

- 300 g whole-wheat linguine
- 1 kg cockles (or mussels, or clams), purged and rinsed
- 1 small onion, finely chopped
- 2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
- 4 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
- 120 ml dry white wine
- 2 egg yolks
- 25–30 g finely grated parmesan
- 1 small knob butter (optional)
- Parsley, finely chopped
- Zest of half a lemon
- Black pepper

**Salted water for pasta**

## Method

### 1. Purge and prepare cockles
Ensure cockles have been purged in salted water and rinsed. Discard any that remain open when tapped.

### 2. Steam cockles
Place cockles in a wide pan with a splash of wine or water. Cover and cook 2–3 minutes until they open. Remove immediately from heat. Transfer cockles to a bowl and strain the cooking liquid through a fine sieve or cloth, keeping the clear liquor and discarding any sediment. Remove most cockle meat from shells, reserving a few whole for presentation if desired.

### 3. Cook pasta
Bring salted water to a rolling boil and cook whole-wheat linguine until just al dente. Reserve a mug of pasta water before draining.

### 4. Build the sauce base
In a large pan, warm olive oil over medium-low heat. Add onion and cook gently for 5–6 minutes until softened but not browned. Add garlic and cook briefly (30–40 seconds). Pour in white wine and strained cockle liquor and allow to simmer gently.

### 5. Combine pasta and sauce
Transfer the cooked linguine directly into the sauce with a splash of pasta water. Toss vigorously to emulsify the oil, liquor, and starch.

### 6. Finish with yolk emulsion
In a separate bowl, whisk egg yolks with parmesan. Slowly add 3–5 tablespoons of hot pasta water while whisking continuously. This tempers the yolks, loosening the mixture and preventing scrambling when added to the pasta. Remove pasta pan from heat and immediately add the yolk mixture, tossing continuously to form a glossy sauce. Add cockle meat and optional butter, then finish with parsley, lemon zest, and black pepper. Add more water from the boiled pasta to increase the sauce. Serve immediately.

- **Energy:** approximately 700–760 kcal
- **Protein:** ~30 g
- **Carbohydrate:** ~70–75 g
- **Fibre:** ~10–12 g
- **Fat:** ~30–35 g

### Micronutrient highlights
- Very high vitamin B12
- High iron and zinc
- Significant selenium
- Meaningful choline from egg yolk
- Marine taurine intake estimated 300–450 mg per serving

Values vary with cockle yield and pasta brand.

## BRAIN Diet Summary

This dish targets multiple regulatory domains:

- **Neurotransmitter support:** taurine, iron, zinc, B12
- **Bioenergetics:** B-vitamins, selenium, whole-grain carbohydrates
- **Inflammation modulation:** olive oil polyphenols, allium compounds, flavonoids from parsley
- **Gut-brain axis:** whole-grain fibre and prebiotic substrates from onion and garlic
- **Membrane and signalling support:** egg yolk phospholipids and choline

The recipe demonstrates how traditional culinary techniques can be used to construct a metabolically stable, micronutrient-dense meal without relying on heavy dairy or processed ingredients.
