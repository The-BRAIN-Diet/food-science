## Overview

This deeply nourishing stew is made from **slow-cooked turkey wings**, releasing gelatin and **glycine-rich collagen** into the broth. It's a **budget-friendly** meal. Turkey wings provide **tryptophan** (an amino acid precursor to serotonin), **selenium**, and **B vitamins** — nutrients involved in various body processes including mood regulation.

## Ingredients

- 2 large **turkey wings** (around 1 kg)
- 1 **onion**, chopped
- 2 **carrots**, diced
- 2 **celery sticks**, chopped
- 3 cloves **garlic**, minced
- 1 tbsp **apple cider vinegar** (helps extract minerals from bones)
- 2 tbsp **olive oil**
- 1 tsp **turmeric** (optional)
- 1 tsp **thyme** or **rosemary**
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Water to cover (~1.5 L)

## Method

1. In a large pot or Dutch oven, sauté onions, garlic, carrots, and celery in olive oil until soft (5–7 min).

2. Add the turkey wings and brown lightly on all sides.

3. Add turmeric and herbs; stir to coat.

4. Pour in enough water to fully submerge wings; add apple cider vinegar.

5. Bring to boil, then reduce to **low simmer** and cook for **3–4 hours**, skimming any foam.

6. Remove turkey wings, separate meat from bones and cartilage.

7. Return shredded meat to broth; discard bones or reserve for stock.

8. Taste and season. Serve hot with optional leafy greens or fermented vegetables.
