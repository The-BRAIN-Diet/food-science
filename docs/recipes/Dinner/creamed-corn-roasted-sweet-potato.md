## Overview

This dish illustrates a core BRAIN Diet principle: preparation and food structure influence nutrient availability and metabolic response as much as ingredient selection. Roasting the sweet potato softens plant cell walls and enhances carotenoid accessibility while providing a fibre-rich carbohydrate base with a relatively gradual glucose release. The corn is gently heated and partially blended to disrupt plant cell matrices, improving the release of lutein and zeaxanthin. Butter, curried coconut milk, olive oil, and parmesan create a mixed lipid phase that facilitates absorption of these fat-soluble compounds while also moderating gastric emptying and stabilising the post-prandial glucose response. Served with broccoli, the meal also provides additional fibre, micronutrients, and glucosinolate-derived compounds formed through myrosinase activation when the broccoli is chopped before cooking.

## Ingredients (1 serving)

- 1 large sweet potato (≈350 g raw)
- 1 tin sweetcorn, drained (≈240 g)
- 150 ml full-fat curried coconut milk (or 150 ml coconut milk + 1 tsp curry powder)
- 30 g butter
- 25 g parmesan, finely grated
- 1 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
- Salt and black pepper

**To serve:**
- 150 g broccoli, steamed (ideally cut ~30 minutes before cooking)

## Method

### Roasting the sweet potato
Preheat oven to 200 °C. Pierce the potato and rub lightly with oil and salt. Roast 45–60 minutes until fully softened. Rest briefly before splitting.

### Preparing the creamed corn
Melt butter in a pan over medium-low heat. Add drained corn and cook 3–4 minutes. Add curried coconut milk and simmer gently ~5–6 minutes. Blend roughly 70 % of the mixture until smooth, return to the pan with remaining kernels. Remove from heat, stir in parmesan, and season to taste.

### Assembly
Split the roasted potato, spoon the creamed corn on top, finish with olive oil, and serve with broccoli.

## Nutritional information (estimated)

Whole plate (including broccoli and olive oil)

- **Energy:** ~880–910 kcal
- **Protein:** ~22 g
- **Carbohydrate:** ~115 g
  - Sugars: ~30–35 g (primarily intrinsic)
  - Fibre: ~20 g
- **Fat:** ~45 g
  - Saturated fat: ~26–28 g (mainly curried coconut milk and butter)

## Functional highlights

- High carotenoid availability (beta-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin) supported by lipid phase
- High potassium and fibre content
- Mixed macronutrient structure supporting stable glucose response
- Broccoli contributes vitamin C, folate, and glucosinolate-derived compounds

## Footnote: Sweet Potato Surface Syrup

The sticky syrup that may appear is primarily composed of these natural sugars, but contains small quantities of potassium, magnesium, and other soluble minerals, along with trace carotenoids and phenolic compounds. Retaining this syrup while cooking is worthwhile.

**Optimal "syrup harvest" setup**
1. Thick glass baking dish
2. Potato slightly tilted
3. One small piercing on the lower side
4. 1–2 tbsp water in the dish corner
5. Roast at ~190 °C
6. Collect syrup just before the end
