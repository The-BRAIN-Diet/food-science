# Roasted Aubergine with Herb Olive Oil

<img src="/img/recipes/Roasted-eggplant.webp" alt="Roasted aubergine with herb olive oil and balsamic drizzle" width="480" />

## Overview

This aubergine dish is built around a two-stage roasting method: first to soften and caramelise the flesh, then to absorb a late-added herb oil that carries garlic, thyme, rosemary, and chilli. Adding the oil toward the end prevents scorching while allowing the aubergine to soak up flavour and develop a glossy finish.

A small drizzle of balsamic vinegar at serving sharpens the dish and balances the richness of the olive oil.

## Notes

- Aubergine absorbs oil readily; adding the herb oil late prevents it becoming greasy.
- Grinding the herbs releases aroma and helps them disperse evenly.
- Balsamic vinegar adds acidity and contrast without masking the herb flavours.
