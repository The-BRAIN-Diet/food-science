# Saffron Roast Potatoes

<img src="/img/recipes/htc-crunchy-roast-potatoes-with-saffron.webp" alt="Saffron roast potatoes" width="480" />

## Overview

These roast potatoes are designed to deliver crisp edges, soft centres, and a warm saffron aroma without overpowering the dishes they accompany. The method separates the structural roasting fat from the aromatic finishing oil, allowing the potatoes to develop a proper crust while preserving the colour and fragrance of the saffron. 

Keeping the saffron oil simple helps maintain a clear golden tone, allowing the potatoes to contribute both texture and visual contrast to the plate.

## Proviso

These potatoes are primarily included as a classic structural side rather than a nutrient-dense component of the meal. Roast potatoes are starch-forward and do not rank highly for metabolic resilience on their own. However, they can still contribute flavour, satisfaction, and visual balance when used in moderation within a broader meal.

In this preparation, a relatively generous quantity of saffron is used across the meal (approximately 0.35 g split between two servings). Saffron contains compounds that have been studied in relation to oxidative stress, mood regulation, and neurochemical signalling. While culinary use does not replicate the controlled dosing of supplementation, quantities of this scale fall within — and in some cases exceed — the range investigated in human studies. When prepared carefully and used regularly in cooking, saffron may therefore contribute to therapeutic effects.

The herb oil used alongside the roasted aubergine side dish also contains roughly one gram of rosemary leaves blended into olive oil. Rosemary is naturally rich in polyphenols and terpene compounds that have been studied for their roles in antioxidant activity. Drizzling a small amount of this oil over the potatoes after roasting adds aromatic depth while introducing additional herb-derived compounds without compromising the saffron's colour or flavour.

Together, these elements illustrate how even traditional starch-based sides can be paired with herbs, spices, and high-quality fats to increase flavour complexity and ingredient diversity.

## Ingredients (serves 4)

- 1.2–1.5 kg floury potatoes (Maris Piper, King Edward, or similar like Binte)
- 3–4 tbsp roasting fat  
  *(duck fat for richness, or olive oil for a lighter version)*
- salt

### Saffron finishing oil
- generous pinch saffron threads
- 2–3 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 tsp warm water
- pinch salt (optional)

---

## Method

### 1. Prepare the potatoes
1. Peel and cut into large chunks.
2. Place in cold salted water and bring to a boil.
3. Simmer **12–14 minutes** until the edges soften. Drain and let dry for 20 minutes.
4. Shake in a pan with the lid on, turn the pan upside down, shake again to roughen the surfaces.
5. Leave to dry another **5–10 minutes**.

---

### 2. Start roasting
1. Heat oven to **220 °C (200 °C fan)**.
2. Heat the roasting fat in a tray for **5 minutes**. *(Use the fat depending upon what you are serving with; if duck, render the duck fat and use that; if not, olive oil is good.)*
3. Add the potatoes and turn to coat well.
4. Roast **35–45 minutes**, turning once or twice, until deeply golden and crisp.

### 3. Prepare the saffron oil
1. Crush saffron threads.
2. Add **1 tsp warm water** and leave **5–10 minutes** to bloom.
3. Stir into olive oil.

---

### 4. Finish the potatoes
1. About **10 minutes before the end**, spoon the saffron oil over the potatoes.
2. Turn gently to coat.
3. Return to the oven to finish crisping and allow the saffron aroma to bloom.
