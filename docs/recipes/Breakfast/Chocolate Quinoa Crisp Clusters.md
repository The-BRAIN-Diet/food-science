## Overview

A cereal-to-snack hybrid engineered with whole quinoa microstructure, flax mucilage binding, and solid-phase lipid crystallisation. Designed for steady energy, a low glycemic profile, and spoonable crunch. The intact quinoa grain structure provides aeration and mechanical fracture points, while flax mucilage binds clusters and coconut oil crystallisation creates a protective lipid shell that preserves crunch.

## Ingredients

### Core
- 2 cups cooked quinoa, cooled & surface-dried
- 2 tbsp homemade oat flour (finely blended rolled oats)
- 1 tbsp ground flaxseed
- 2–3 tbsp unsweetened cocoa or cacao powder
- ¼ tsp fine sea salt

### Wet binder
- 1–2 tbsp refined coconut oil, melted (35–45 °C)
- 2–2.5 tbsp maple syrup or date syrup
- 1 tsp vanilla extract

### Optional texture boosters
- 2–3 tbsp puffed quinoa, for surface coating
- ½ tsp cinnamon
- 1–2 tbsp hemp hearts (protein upgrade)

## Method

1. **Cook & cool the quinoa**: Rinse quinoa thoroughly. Cook using 2:1 water : quinoa ratio until tender. Drain well. Spread quinoa onto a tray and let it air-dry 10–20 minutes. This reduces surface moisture and preserves the grain's outer wall, which is key for cluster crunch.

2. **Mix the dry ingredients**: In a large bowl, combine quinoa (whole, not blended), oat flour, ground flax, cocoa/cacao, and salt. Fold gently until distributed. Avoid mashing — intact grains provide microstructure and aeration.

3. **Add the wet binder**: Melt coconut oil (35–45 °C — not smoking). Stir maple/date syrup + vanilla into the oil. Pour into the bowl and fold until coated. The coconut oil coats the surface of the clusters and crystallises as it cools, forming a thin lipid shell that reduces moisture absorption and helps maintain the cereal-style crunch.

4. **Form clusters**: Scoop ½ tbsp (6–8 g) portions. Lightly compress into loose clusters — not spheres. Place on a parchment-lined tray with 2 cm spacing. Small clusters offer a higher surface-to-volume ratio, leading to stronger cereal-type crunch.

5. **Bake low + slow**: 165 °C (325 °F) — 45–55 min. Rotate tray halfway. They should smell like chocolate cereal, not brownies. The aim is dehydration, not caramelisation.

6. **Cool fully**: Rest 20–30 minutes. As the clusters cool, the lipid shell sets and the internal structure stabilises.

7. **Puffed quinoa finish (optional)**: Place puffed quinoa in a bowl. Roll or pat the cooled clusters over the surface. This preserves the identity of puffed grains and prevents them from softening during baking.

## Extra Guidance

⚠️ **Do not blend cooked quinoa**: Blending destroys grain walls resulting in a fudge texture. You lose aeration and crunch.

**Storage**: Airtight container: 7–10 days room temp. Refrigerated: max crunch retention.

**Serving**: Dry as a snack, as cereal with milk / oat milk / coconut milk, or mixed into granola or yogurt bowls.

~180–220 kcal per 30g serving · 6–8g protein · high fiber · low glycemic · moderate polyphenols

## Brain Health Notes

- Quinoa provides complete plant protein with all essential amino acids, supporting neurotransmitter synthesis and steady energy release.
- Flax seeds contribute ALA omega-3, soluble fiber (mucilage), and lignans, supporting gut microbiome health and SCFA production.
- Cocoa/cacao provides polyphenols (flavanols) that support cognitive function and reduce oxidative stress.
- Coconut oil's medium-chain triglycerides provide alternative energy substrate, while its crystallisation creates a protective lipid shell that preserves texture.
- The intact grain microstructure provides mechanical fracture points and aeration, creating the characteristic crunch without relying on added fats.
- Low glycemic profile from whole grains and minimal added sugars supports stable blood glucose and reduced insulin spikes.
