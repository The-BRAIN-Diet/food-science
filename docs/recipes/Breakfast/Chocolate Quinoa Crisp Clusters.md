# chocolate quinoa crisp clusters

> A cereal-to-snack hybrid engineered with whole quinoa microstructure, flax mucilage binding, and solid-phase lipid crystallisation. Designed for steady energy, a low glycemic profile, and spoonable crunch.

## 🧾 Ingredients

### Core

- **2 cups cooked quinoa**, cooled & surface-dried  

- **2 tbsp homemade oat flour** (finely blended rolled oats)  

- **1 tbsp ground flaxseed**  

- **2–3 tbsp unsweetened cocoa or cacao powder**  

- **¼ tsp fine sea salt**

### Wet binder

- **1–2 tbsp refined coconut oil**, melted (35–45 °C)  

- **2–2.5 tbsp maple syrup or date syrup**  

- **1 tsp vanilla extract**

### Optional texture boosters

- **2–3 tbsp puffed quinoa**, for surface coating  

- **½ tsp cinnamon**  

- **1–2 tbsp hemp hearts** (protein upgrade)

---

## 🥣 Method

### 1. Cook & cool the quinoa

- Rinse quinoa thoroughly.

- Cook using **2:1 water : quinoa ratio** until tender.

- Drain well.

- Spread quinoa onto a tray and let it **air-dry 10–20 minutes**.

> This reduces surface moisture and preserves the grain's outer wall, which is key for cluster crunch.

---

### 2. Mix the dry ingredients

In a large bowl:

- quinoa (whole, **not blended**)

- oat flour  

- ground flax  

- cocoa/cacao  

- salt

Fold gently until distributed.

> Avoid mashing — intact grains provide microstructure and aeration.

---

### 3. Add the wet binder

- Melt coconut oil (35–45 °C — **not smoking**).

- Stir maple/date syrup + vanilla into the oil.

- Pour into the bowl and fold until coated.

> **The coconut oil coats the surface of the clusters and crystallises as it cools, forming a thin lipid shell that reduces moisture absorption and helps maintain the cereal-style crunch produced by dehydration and the preserved grain structure.**

This is the correct scientific explanation.

---

### 4. Form clusters

- Scoop **½ tbsp (6–8 g)** portions.

- Lightly compress into loose clusters — **not spheres**.

- Place on a parchment-lined tray with **2 cm spacing**.

> Small clusters offer a higher surface-to-volume ratio, leading to stronger cereal-type crunch.

---

### 5. Bake low + slow

**165 °C (325 °F) — 45–55 min.**

Rotate tray halfway.  

They should smell like chocolate cereal, not brownies.

> The aim is **dehydration**, not caramelisation.

---

### 6. Cool fully

Rest **20–30 minutes**.

> As the clusters cool, the lipid shell sets and the internal structure stabilises.

---

### 7. Puffed quinoa finish (optional)

- Place puffed quinoa in a bowl.

- Roll or pat the **cooled** clusters over the surface.

> This preserves the identity of puffed grains and prevents them from softening during baking.

## 🥛 Serving

- Dry as a snack  

- As cereal with milk / oat milk / coconut milk  

- Mixed into granola or yogurt bowls

## 🧠 Mechanistic Overview

### 🔬 Microstructure preservation

Whole quinoa grains provide:

- intact cell walls  

- air pocket formation  

- gentle surface dehydration  

→ **primary source of crunch**

### 🧬 Flax mucilage

Hydrates and forms **gelatinous binding**, adding:

- viscosity  

- cluster cohesion  

- soluble fiber

### 🍫 Cacao/cocoa

Provides:

- polyphenols  

- bitterness modulation  

- antioxidant capacity

### 🧊 Coconut oil crystallisation

As coconut oil cools:

- saturated lipids form semi-rigid crystals  

- a thin shell forms  

- moisture re-entry slows  

→ **crunch is preserved**, not created by the fat itself.

## 💡 Variations

### Higher protein

- +1 tbsp hemp hearts  

- +1 tbsp ground flax  

- or +2 tsp pea protein isolate (sifted)

### Lower glycemic

- Replace maple syrup with **date paste (1–2 tbsp)**  

- Add **½ tsp cinnamon**

### Kids cereal

- Reduce cluster size to **5–6 g**

- Extend air-drying or baking to intensify crunch

---

## 🗄️ Storage

- Airtight container: **7–10 days** room temp  

- Refrigerated: **max crunch retention**

---

## 🧪 Fat misting (premium option)

After cooling:

- mist clusters with **warm coconut oil (35–45 °C)**

- **1–3% of total weight**

- chill 10–15 minutes

> Creates a secondary lipid shell that protects puffed textures and resists humidity.

---

### ⚠️ Do not blend cooked quinoa

Blending destroys grain walls resulting in a fudge texture.  

You lose:

- aeration

- crunch
