## Overview

A warm, savoury breakfast built around eggs, greens, and whole-food carbohydrates. This skillet provides a balanced combination of protein, fibre, and healthy fats to support steady morning energy and satiety.

## Ingredients (1 serving)

**Vegetables**
- 100 g mushrooms, sliced  
- 60–80 g spinach or kale  
- 80 g cherry tomatoes, halved  
- 1 clove garlic, minced  

**Protein**
- 2 large eggs  

**Healthy fats**
- 10 ml extra virgin olive oil  

**Slow carbohydrate base (choose one)**
- 120 g cooked quinoa  
  **or**  
- 120 g cooked buckwheat  

**Seasoning**
- Pinch sea salt  
- Pinch black pepper  
- ½ tsp smoked paprika  

**Optional**
- Slices of avocado  
- Small side of sauerkraut or kimchi  

## Method

1. Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat.  
2. Add the sliced mushrooms and cook for 3–4 minutes until lightly browned.  
3. Add the garlic, cherry tomatoes, salt, pepper, and smoked paprika; cook for 1–2 minutes until fragrant.  
4. Add the spinach or kale and cook until just wilted.  
5. Push the vegetables to one side of the pan and crack in the eggs. Cook to your preference (fried, basted, or gently scrambled alongside the vegetables).  
6. Warm the cooked quinoa or buckwheat in a separate pan or microwave, then place in a bowl as the base.  
7. Top the grain base with the vegetable and egg mixture. Add avocado slices and sauerkraut or kimchi if using, then serve immediately.  

## Extra Guidance

- Cooking the grains in advance makes this a very fast weekday breakfast.  
- You can swap spinach for kale or other leafy greens depending on what you have.  
- Keep heat moderate to avoid over-browning the eggs and vegetables.  

## Nutrition (approximate, per serving)

> Based on: 2 eggs, 120 g cooked quinoa, 100 g mushrooms, 60 g spinach, 80 g cherry tomatoes, 10 ml extra virgin olive oil.

- **Energy:** ~450–500 kcal  
- **Protein:** ~22–25 g  
- **Carbohydrates:** ~45–50 g (from quinoa/buckwheat and vegetables)  
- **Fat:** ~18–22 g (including yolk fats and olive oil)  
- **Fibre:** ~7–9 g  

## Brain Health Notes

- **Eggs** provide complete protein and choline, a nutrient important for phospholipid membranes and acetylcholine synthesis.  
- **Leafy greens** (spinach or kale) supply folate, magnesium, and carotenoids studied for roles in brain and vascular health.  
- **Quinoa or buckwheat** provide slow-digesting carbohydrates and fibre, which can help support steadier morning glucose patterns compared with refined grains.  
- **Extra virgin olive oil** contributes monounsaturated fats and polyphenols associated with cardiovascular and brain health.  
- **Fermented sides** such as sauerkraut or kimchi add probiotics and postbiotic compounds that complement a fibre-rich diet for gut support.
