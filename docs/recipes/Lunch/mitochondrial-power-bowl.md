## Overview

A vibrant, nutrient-dense bowl combining nitrate-rich leafy greens and beets with polyphenol-packed berries, nuts, and seeds. This Mediterranean-inspired meal provides magnesium, B vitamins, polyphenols, and fibre — nutrients studied for their roles in energy metabolism and antioxidant defence.

## Ingredients

- 1 cup cooked quinoa (cooled)
- 2 cups mixed leafy greens (spinach, arugula, or rocket)
- ½ cup roasted beets, diced
- ¼ cup walnuts, roughly chopped
- 2 tbsp pumpkin seeds
- ½ cup fresh blueberries
- 2 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped
- 2 tbsp early harvest olive oil
- 1 tbsp lemon juice
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Optional: 1 tbsp hemp seeds for additional omega-3

## Method

1. Prepare quinoa according to package instructions and allow to cool to room temperature.
2. If using raw beets, roast at 200°C (400°F) for 30-40 minutes until tender, then dice. Alternatively, use pre-cooked beets.
3. In a large bowl, combine the cooled quinoa with mixed leafy greens.
4. Top with roasted beets, walnuts, pumpkin seeds, and blueberries.
5. Whisk together early harvest olive oil, lemon juice, salt, and pepper to create a simple vinaigrette.
6. Drizzle the dressing over the bowl and toss gently.
7. Garnish with fresh parsley and optional hemp seeds.
8. Serve immediately for optimal nutrient retention.

## Extra Guidance

- **Timing**: Best enjoyed as a lunch or light dinner to support daytime energy without evening digestive burden.
- **Preparation**: For maximum nitrate bioavailability, consume leafy greens raw or lightly steamed. Boiling can reduce oxalate content but may diminish some polyphenols.
- **Variations**: Substitute or add other nitrate-rich vegetables like celery, radishes, or beet greens. Swap blueberries for other polyphenol-rich berries (strawberries, raspberries) as available.
- **Protein boost**: Add grilled chicken, salmon, or tempeh for additional complete protein and mitochondrial cofactors.

## Nutrition

- **Calories**: ~520 kcal
- **Protein**: ~18-20 g
- **Fat**: ~28-30 g (primarily healthy monounsaturated and omega-3)
- **Carbohydrates**: ~45-50 g (complex, fiber-rich)
- **Fiber**: ~12-15 g
- **Magnesium**: ~35-40% RDA
- **Polyphenols**: High (from berries, early harvest olive oil, leafy greens, nuts)

## Brain Health Notes

- **Leafy greens and beets** contain dietary nitrates that are studied for their role in nitric oxide and vascular function.
- **Blueberries, walnuts, and early harvest olive oil** provide polyphenols (anthocyanins, ellagitannins, hydroxytyrosol) studied for antioxidant effects.
- **Spinach, pumpkin seeds, and quinoa** provide magnesium, a mineral important for energy metabolism.
- **Quinoa** supplies B vitamins (B1, B2, B3) involved in cellular energy pathways.
- **Walnuts and optional hemp seeds** provide ALA omega-3, a fatty acid important for brain structure.
- **Olive oil, seeds, lemon, and greens** contribute vitamin E, vitamin C, and polyphenols — nutrients associated with antioxidant defence.
