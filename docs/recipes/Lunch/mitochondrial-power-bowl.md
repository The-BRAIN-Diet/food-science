## Overview

A vibrant, nutrient-dense bowl combining nitrate-rich leafy greens and beets with polyphenol-packed berries, nuts, and seeds. This Mediterranean-inspired meal supports mitochondrial energy production through magnesium and B-vitamin cofactors, enhances ATP generation via antioxidant networks, and promotes metabolic resilience through balanced macronutrients and bioactive compounds.

## Ingredients

- 1 cup cooked quinoa (cooled)
- 2 cups mixed leafy greens (spinach, arugula, or rocket)
- ½ cup roasted beets, diced
- ¼ cup walnuts, roughly chopped
- 2 tbsp pumpkin seeds
- ½ cup fresh blueberries
- 2 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped
- 2 tbsp early harvest olive oil
- 1 tbsp lemon juice
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Optional: 1 tbsp hemp seeds for additional omega-3

## Method

1. Prepare quinoa according to package instructions and allow to cool to room temperature.
2. If using raw beets, roast at 200°C (400°F) for 30-40 minutes until tender, then dice. Alternatively, use pre-cooked beets.
3. In a large bowl, combine the cooled quinoa with mixed leafy greens.
4. Top with roasted beets, walnuts, pumpkin seeds, and blueberries.
5. Whisk together early harvest olive oil, lemon juice, salt, and pepper to create a simple vinaigrette.
6. Drizzle the dressing over the bowl and toss gently.
7. Garnish with fresh parsley and optional hemp seeds.
8. Serve immediately for optimal nutrient retention.

## Extra Guidance

- **Timing**: Best enjoyed as a lunch or light dinner to support daytime energy without evening digestive burden.
- **Preparation**: For maximum nitrate bioavailability, consume leafy greens raw or lightly steamed. Boiling can reduce oxalate content but may diminish some polyphenols.
- **Variations**: Substitute or add other nitrate-rich vegetables like celery, radishes, or beet greens. Swap blueberries for other polyphenol-rich berries (strawberries, raspberries) as available.
- **Protein boost**: Add grilled chicken, salmon, or tempeh for additional complete protein and mitochondrial cofactors.

## Nutrition

- **Calories**: ~520 kcal
- **Protein**: ~18-20 g
- **Fat**: ~28-30 g (primarily healthy monounsaturated and omega-3)
- **Carbohydrates**: ~45-50 g (complex, fiber-rich)
- **Fiber**: ~12-15 g
- **Magnesium**: ~35-40% RDA
- **Polyphenols**: High (from berries, early harvest olive oil, leafy greens, nuts)

## Brain Health Notes

- **Nitrate conversion**: Leafy greens and beets provide dietary nitrates that convert to nitric oxide, supporting vascular function and mitochondrial efficiency.
- **Polyphenol synergy**: Blueberries, walnuts, and early harvest olive oil deliver diverse polyphenols (anthocyanins, ellagitannins, hydroxytyrosol) that activate Nrf2 pathways, reducing oxidative stress and supporting mitochondrial biogenesis.
- **Magnesium for ATP**: Spinach, pumpkin seeds, and quinoa provide magnesium essential for ATP synthase activity and mitochondrial energy production.
- **B-vitamin cofactors**: Quinoa supplies B vitamins (B1, B2, B3) that support NAD+ synthesis and mitochondrial electron transport chain function.
- **Omega-3 balance**: Walnuts and optional hemp seeds provide ALA omega-3, supporting membrane fluidity and mitochondrial signaling pathways.
- **Antioxidant networks**: The combination of vitamin E (from early harvest olive oil and seeds), vitamin C (from lemon and greens), and polyphenols creates a synergistic antioxidant defense system protecting mitochondrial DNA and reducing neuroinflammation.
