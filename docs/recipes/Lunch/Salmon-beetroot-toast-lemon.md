## Overview

A fast, brain-forward open sandwich: **omega-3 rich salmon + nitrate/polyphenol beetroot + lemon acidity** for a sharp, savoury bite. Ideal for lunch when you need high protein without a long prep. [Salmon sources](/docs/recipes/Lunch/salmon-beetroot-toast-lemon#salmon-sourcing), like all seafood, are important to research.

## Ingredients (1 serving)

- Bread, wholegrain or sourdough: **1 slice (40 g)**
- Salmon, cooked (or canned, drained): **90 g**
- Beetroot, grated (raw or pre-cooked): **60 g**
- Lemon juice: **15 ml** (1 tbsp)
- Extra virgin olive oil (optional): **5 ml** (1 tsp)
- Salt + black pepper: to taste

**Optional upgrades (very BRAIN):**
- 1 tsp capers *or* chopped dill/parsley
- 1 tsp Dijon mustard (mix into beetroot)
- A few rocket/arugula leaves

## Method

1. **Toast the bread** until deeply golden (better texture, slower eating, improved satisfaction).
2. **Mix the beetroot:** In a bowl combine grated beetroot + **15 ml lemon juice** + a pinch of salt and pepper. Add **5 ml EVOO** if using.
3. **Add the salmon:** Flake salmon over the toast. Season lightly (pepper is enough if salmon is already salted).
4. **Top & press:** Pile the lemony beetroot on top. Press gently so it holds together.
5. **Finish:** Extra lemon squeeze if you like it brighter.

## Nutrition (estimated, per serving)

> Based on: 40 g bread, 90 g cooked salmon, 60 g beetroot, **15 ml lemon juice**, 5 ml EVOO.

- **Calories:** ~**395 kcal**
- **Protein:** ~**25 g**
- **Carbohydrates:** ~**33 g**
- **Fat:** ~**18 g**
- **Fiber:** ~**5 g**
- **Omega-3 (EPA+DHA):** ~**1.8–2.4 g** *(depends on salmon type)*

### Key micronutrient highlights (why it's "BRAIN")
- **DHA/EPA (salmon):** Provides omega-3 fats important for brain structure and signaling.
- **Nitrates (beetroot):** Beetroot contains dietary nitrates that are studied for their role in nitric oxide signaling.
- **Folate + potassium (beetroot):** Provides folate and potassium involved in one-carbon metabolism and electrolyte balance.
- **Vitamin C (lemon):** A source of vitamin C and polyphenol-preserving acidity.

## Brain Health Notes

- **Salmon** provides EPA and DHA, omega-3 fats that are important for brain structure and cell membranes.
- **Beetroot** contains dietary nitrates that are studied for their role in nitric oxide and vascular function.
- **Lemon** provides vitamin C, a water-soluble antioxidant.
- **Wholegrain/sourdough bread** provides fibre and a slower release of carbohydrate compared with refined bread.

### Salmon sourcing {#salmon-sourcing}

Both wild-caught and responsibly farm-raised salmon can be good options. Where possible, choose salmon that is sustainably sourced and labelled as free from routine antibiotics and unnecessary additives, whether wild or farmed. Please be sure to research your supermarket and their suppliers — many are moving towards more sustainable, ethical sourcing (e.g. [M&amp;S Aquaculture and Fisheries](https://corporate.marksandspencer.com/sustainability/our-products/aquaculture-and-fisheries)). For a balanced overview of wild versus farmed salmon, see resources such as the summary from [North Coast Seafoods](https://www.northcoastseafoods.com/blogs/know-seafood/farm-raised-vs-wild-caught-salmon).

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) jointly publish [guidance on fish mercury levels](https://www.fda.gov/food/environmental-contaminants-food/technical-information-development-fdaepa-advice-about-eating-fish-those-who-might-become-or-are). They categorize fish into "Best Choices", "Good Choices", and "Choices to Avoid" based on average mercury concentrations and safe weekly intake levels. Salmon is repeatedly in the "Best Choices" category because it consistently has low mercury relative to the reference dose used to set safety advice (≤0.15 µg/g).
