## Overview
A Mediterranean-style bowl combining salmon, avocado, pistachio, raw cacao nibs, and pomegranates. These ingredients provide omega-3 fats, polyphenols, fibre, and a favourable omega-6:omega-3 ratio. Lemon and fresh greens add brightness, fibre, and micronutrients.

## Ingredients (2 servings)
- 120–150 g **wild salmon** (baked or lightly pan-seared)
- 1 **ripe avocado**, sliced
- 40–50 g **pistachios** (raw or dry-roasted, unsalted)
- 1 cup **mixed leafy greens** (rocket, lamb’s lettuce, baby spinach)
- 1 tbsp **raw cacao nibs**
- **handful of pomegranate seeds** (arils)
- 1–2 tbsp **early harvest olive oil**
- 1 tsp **hemp seeds** or **chia seeds**
- juice of **½ lemon**
- a few sprigs of **mint** or basil
- sea salt to taste

## Method

1. **Cook the salmon**  
   Bake at **180°C for 10–12 min**, or gently pan-sear.  
   Avoid browning or hard searing to protect omega-3 fatty acids.

2. **Plate the greens and avocado**  
   Arrange leafy greens in a wide bowl. Add sliced avocado.

3. **Add the salmon**  
   Flake or slice gently.  
   Keep structure visible for visual and textural balance.

4. **Add toppings**  
   Sprinkle pistachios, chia/hemp.  
   Lightly scatter cacao nibs (0.5–1 tsp per bowl) to provide bitterness and crunch.  
   Sprinkle a handful of pomegranate seeds over the bowl for sweetness and color.

5. **Dress**  
   Drizzle early harvest olive oil, add lemon juice, season lightly with salt.  
   Finish with mint or basil leaves.

## Extra Guidance
- Serve at **room temperature**.  
- Do not add sweet dressings — **cacao functions as a bitter spice, not dessert**.  
- Sprinkle cacao nibs **just before serving** to preserve snap and aromatic bitterness.

## Brain Health Notes

- **Salmon** provides EPA and DHA, omega-3 fats important for brain structure and cell membranes.
- **Pistachios and avocado** supply oleic acid and other fats; avocado contains compounds studied in relation to endocannabinoid-like signalling.
- **Cacao nibs** provide polyphenols (flavanols) that are studied for antioxidant and vascular effects.
- **Early harvest olive oil** contains phenolic compounds associated with antioxidant activity.
- **Leafy greens and nuts** provide fibre that feeds gut bacteria; fibre fermentation produces SCFAs, which are studied for gut–brain communication.

### Salmon sourcing

This bowl works with either wild-caught or responsibly farm-raised salmon. Aim for salmon that is sustainably sourced and clearly labelled as free from routine antibiotics and unnecessary additives, whether wild or farmed. Please be sure to research your supermarket and their suppliers — many are moving towards more sustainable, ethical sourcing (e.g. [M&amp;S Aquaculture and Fisheries](https://corporate.marksandspencer.com/sustainability/our-products/aquaculture-and-fisheries)). For a balanced overview of wild versus farmed salmon, see resources such as the summary from [North Coast Seafoods](https://www.northcoastseafoods.com/blogs/know-seafood/farm-raised-vs-wild-caught-salmon).

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) jointly publish [guidance on fish mercury levels](https://www.fda.gov/food/environmental-contaminants-food/technical-information-development-fdaepa-advice-about-eating-fish-those-who-might-become-or-are). They categorize fish into "Best Choices", "Good Choices", and "Choices to Avoid" based on average mercury concentrations and safe weekly intake levels. Salmon is repeatedly in the "Best Choices" category because it consistently has low mercury relative to the reference dose used to set safety advice (≤0.15 µg/g).
