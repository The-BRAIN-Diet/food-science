- Tag each recipe page with the foods it contains where the food is a significant proportion of the meal.
- Tag the page with "Recipe" too, so that it appears in index.md.
- In the front matter, list_image: (image file for recipe)
- Tag with the main biological target tags.

## Meal Category Tagging for Drinks

- **Drinks can be tagged with multiple meal categories**: A drink recipe can be tagged with both "Drinks" and a meal category (e.g., "Breakfast", "Lunch", "Dinner", "Snacks") simultaneously.
- **Two organizational approaches are acceptable**:
  - **Meal-specific drinks**: Drinks consumed at specific meals (e.g., breakfast smoothies) should be in their meal category folder (`Breakfast/`, `Lunch/`, etc.) with both the meal category tag AND "Drinks" tag.
  - **General/anytime drinks**: Drinks that can be consumed at any time (e.g., evening beverages, general hydration drinks) can remain in the `Drinks/` folder with only the "Drinks" tag.
- **Example**: A smoothie consumed for breakfast should have both "Breakfast" and "Drinks" tags, and the file should remain in the `Breakfast/` folder. A general evening drink can be in the `Drinks/` folder with just the "Drinks" tag.
- **Future category**: Drinks will eventually be added as a new category under foods, but recipes should remain organized by meal category when applicable.

The Format of the page should have this structure:

- Image of the recipe.
- Overview: A single paragraph description describing the recipe, what it is, where it comes from, why it's delicious and good for you. Keep it brief.
- Ingredients: a list of ingredients and amounts.
- Method: a numbered list of steps.
- Extra Guidance (optional): Any other notes for how or when to take it.
- Nutrition: calories, etc.
- Brain Health Notes: some notes about why it is particularly helpful for your brain.
- Foods/Substances: should be <RecipeFoods details={frontMatter} /> (displays foods with hyperlinked substances for each food)
- Biological Target Matrix: should be <RecipeMatrix details={frontMatter} />

Use the `Ginger Yogurt & Blueberry Bowl.md` page as an example.
