The Format of the page should have this structure:

- Ingredients: a list of ingredients and amounts.
- Method: a numbered list of steps.
- Extra Guidance (optional): Any other notes for how or when to take it.
- Nutrition: calories, etc.
- Brain Health Notes: some notes about why it is particularly helpful for your brain.
- Foods: should be <RecipeFoods details={frontMatter} /> (displays foods with hyperlinked substances for each food)
- Biological Target Matrix: should be <RecipeMatrix details={frontMatter} />
