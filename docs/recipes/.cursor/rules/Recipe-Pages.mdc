- Tag each recipe page with the foods it contains where the food is a significant proportion of the meal.
- Tag the page with "Recipe" too, so that it appears in index.md.
- In the front matter, list_image: (image file for recipe)
- Tag with the main biological target tags.

## Meal Category Tagging for Drinks

- **Drinks in the Drinks/ folder**: Tag with "Drinks" only. Do not add "Dinner", "Lunch", or other meal tags, so they appear only on the Drinks page and not on meal-specific pages (e.g. Dinner).
- **Meal-specific drinks** (e.g. breakfast smoothies): Place in the meal category folder (`Breakfast/`, `Lunch/`, etc.) with both the meal category tag AND "Drinks" tag.
- **General drinks** (e.g. Sourdough Soda, Turmeric Milk): Keep in `Drinks/` folder with only the "Drinks" tag.
- **Future category**: Drinks will eventually be added as a new category under foods, but recipes should remain organized by meal category when applicable.

The Format of the page should have this structure:

- Image of the recipe.
- Overview: A single paragraph description describing the recipe, what it is, where it comes from, why it's delicious and good for you. Keep it brief.
- Ingredients: a list of ingredients and amounts.
- Method: a numbered list of steps.
- Extra Guidance (optional): Any other notes for how or when to take it.
- Nutrition: calories, etc.
- Brain Health Notes: some notes about why it is particularly helpful for your brain.
- Foods/Substances: should be <RecipeFoods details={frontMatter} /> (displays foods with hyperlinked substances for each food)
- Biological Target Matrix: should be <RecipeMatrix details={frontMatter} />

Use the `Ginger Yogurt & Blueberry Bowl.md` page as an example.
