## Overview

A refreshing, lightly sparkling kvass-style drink made from toasted stale sourdough, cinnamon, and raisins. Low sugar, gut-supportive, hydrating — and completely natural.

## Ingredients (1.5–2 L)

- 200–250 g stale sourdough bread (ideally wholegrain or rye-based)
- 1.5 L water
- 50–70 g sugar or honey (fuel for fermentation; most is consumed)
- 1 small handful raisins (10–15)
- 1 cinnamon stick (or ½ tsp ground cinnamon)
- *Optional but helpful:* 1 tbsp active sourdough starter
- *Optional flavour extras:* strip of lemon peel; a few cloves; thin slice of fresh ginger

## Method

1. **Toast the bread**  
   Cut the stale sourdough into chunks and toast at **180°C** until deep golden-brown with some darker edges. This builds flavour, colour, and melanoidin/antioxidant complexity.

2. **Make the infusion**  
   Add the toasted bread, raisins, cinnamon (and any optional peel/spices) to a large pot. Pour over **1.5 L** of water. Bring just to a **gentle simmer** for 5–10 minutes, then switch off the heat.

3. **Steep and cool**  
   Let the mixture steep as it cools to room temperature (about 1–2 hours). You're making a flavoured, bread-based "tea" as the base of the soda.

4. **Strain**  
   Pour through a fine sieve or cheesecloth into a fermentation jug or large jar. Gently press the bread to extract liquid, but don't mash it into paste.

5. **Sweeten and inoculate**  
   Once the liquid is just warm (not hot), stir in the **50–70 g sugar or honey** until fully dissolved. If using, add **1 tbsp sourdough starter** and stir again.

6. **Primary fermentation (12–36 hours)**  
   Cover the jar with a clean cloth or a loose lid. Leave at **room temperature** for 12–36 hours. At ~12 h: very mild tang, little fizz; at ~24 h: more flavour, light carbonation; at ~36+ h: tangier, more pronounced fermentation. Taste every 8–12 h and stop when it reaches a pleasant balance of light sourness and gentle fizz.

7. **Bottle and carbonate**  
   Strain again if needed into clean swing-top bottles or screw-cap glass bottles. Add **2–3 fresh raisins** to each bottle (traditional kvass trick: they float when it's ready). Seal and leave at room temperature for **6–12 hours** to build carbonation.

8. **Chill and serve**  
   Move bottles to the fridge to slow fermentation. Open carefully (over the sink the first time), pour into a glass, and enjoy chilled.

## Extra Guidance

- Best consumed within **3–4 days** for optimal flavour and low alcohol (typically well under 1% if timings are modest).
- For a **more citrusy profile**, add lemon peel and reduce cinnamon slightly.
- For a **ginger version**, add a thin slice of fresh ginger during the initial simmer, then remove before bottling.
- If you prefer it less sweet, ferment closer to the 36-hour mark so more sugar is consumed by the microbes.
- **UPF profile:** 100% non-UPF; uses simple ingredients and fermentation rather than additives.
- **Use case:** As a low-sugar, low-alcohol alternative to soft drinks in the evening, or as a gentle digestive drink with meals.
