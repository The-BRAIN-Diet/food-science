# Sourdough Soda (Fermented Cinnamon & Raisin Drink)

<img src="/img/recipes/sourdough drink.jpg" alt="Sourdough soda drink" width="480" />

A refreshing, lightly sparkling kvass-style drink made from toasted stale sourdough, cinnamon, and raisins.  
Low sugar, gut-supportive, hydrating — and completely natural.

---

## 🥤 Ingredients (1.5–2 L)

- 200–250 g stale sourdough bread (ideally wholegrain or rye-based)
- 1.5 L water
- 50–70 g sugar or honey (fuel for fermentation; most is consumed)
- 1 small handful raisins (10–15)
- 1 cinnamon stick (or ½ tsp ground cinnamon)
- *Optional but helpful:* 1 tbsp active sourdough starter
- *Optional flavour extras:*  
  - strip of lemon peel  
  - a few cloves  
  - thin slice of fresh ginger

## 🍞 Method

1. **Toast the bread**  
   Cut the stale sourdough into chunks and toast at **180 °C** until deep golden-brown with some darker edges.  
   This builds flavour, colour, and melanoidin/antioxidant complexity.

2. **Make the infusion**  
   Add the toasted bread, raisins, cinnamon (and any optional peel/spices) to a large pot.  
   Pour over **1.5 L** of water.  
   Bring just to a **gentle simmer** for 5–10 minutes, then switch off the heat.

3. **Steep and cool**  
   Let the mixture steep as it cools to room temperature (about 1–2 hours).  
   You’re making a flavoured, bread-based “tea” as the base of the soda.

4. **Strain**  
   Pour through a fine sieve or cheesecloth into a fermentation jug or large jar.  
   Gently press the bread to extract liquid, but don’t mash it into paste.

5. **Sweeten and inoculate**  
   Once the liquid is just warm (not hot), stir in the **50–70 g sugar or honey** until fully dissolved.  
   If using, add **1 tbsp sourdough starter** and stir again.

6. **Primary fermentation (12–36 hours)**  
   Cover the jar with a clean cloth or a loose lid.  
   Leave at **room temperature** for 12–36 hours.  
   - At ~12 h: very mild tang, little fizz  
   - At ~24 h: more flavour, light carbonation  
   - At ~36+ h: tangier, more pronounced fermentation  
   Taste every 8–12 h and stop when it reaches a pleasant balance of light sourness and gentle fizz.

7. **Bottle and carbonate**  
   Strain again if needed into clean swing-top bottles or screw-cap glass bottles.  
   Add **2–3 fresh raisins** to each bottle (traditional kvass trick: they float when it’s ready).  
   Seal and leave at room temperature for **6–12 hours** to build carbonation.

8. **Chill and serve**  
   Move bottles to the fridge to slow fermentation.  
   Open carefully (over the sink the first time), pour into a glass, and enjoy chilled.

## 🌿 Notes & Variations

- Best consumed within **3–4 days** for optimal flavour and low alcohol (typically well under 1% if timings are modest).
- For a **more citrusy profile**, add lemon peel and reduce cinnamon slightly.
- For a **ginger version**, add a thin slice of fresh ginger during the initial simmer, then remove before bottling.
- If you prefer it less sweet, ferment closer to the 36-hour mark so more sugar is consumed by the microbes.

## 🔍 BRAIN Diet Snapshot

- **UPF profile:** 100% non-UPF; uses simple ingredients and fermentation rather than additives.
- **Use case:** As a **low-sugar, low-alcohol alternative** to soft drinks in the evening, or as a gentle digestive drink with meals.

# 🧠 Scientific Sidebar

<Collapse title="Nutrient & Fermentation Notes">

### 1. Fermentation

- The drink captures **lactic acid bacteria and wild yeasts** from the sourdough bread.  
- Fermentation generates **organic acids** (lactate, acetate) and **postbiotic molecules** (small peptides, microbial metabolites).  
- Regular fermented-food intake is associated with increased diversity of gut microbes.

### 2. Fibre and SCFAs

- The drink itself is not a fibre source. In the context of the BRAIN Diet, it is a **supporting ferment** alongside fibre-rich meals.

### 3. Minerals and B Vitamins

- Soaking and simmering sourdough bread can solubilise **magnesium**, **potassium**, **trace zinc**, and some **B vitamins** (B1, B3, B6).  
- Sourdough fermentation reduces phytates, which may enhance mineral bioavailability.

### 4. Toasting and Maillard Compounds

- Toasting the bread creates **melanoidins** and transforms polyphenols — Maillard-derived compounds studied for mild antioxidant and prebiotic effects.

### 5. Glycaemic Profile

- Most of the added sugar is **consumed by microbes** during fermentation, reducing the final glycaemic load.  
- Compared to sweet soft drinks, sourdough soda typically causes smaller glucose spikes.

### 6. Sensory Experience

- Gentle carbonation, cinnamon aroma, and mild acidity offer sensory richness without ultra-processed stimulation — a calming, predictable evening drink pattern.
