## Overview

Turmeric milk combines turmeric (curcumin) with milk/fat, enhancing curcumin absorption and providing a vehicle for brain-focused bioactive herbs. The fat in milk significantly improves curcumin bioavailability, and adding black pepper (piperine) further enhances absorption. This warming drink is ideal for evening consumption and supports anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective pathways.

## Ingredients

- 1 cup milk (dairy or plant-based)
- 1 tsp turmeric powder
- ½ tsp black pepper (optional, for enhanced absorption)
- 1 tsp honey or maple syrup (optional, for sweetness)
- ½ tsp ground cinnamon (optional)
- Pinch of ground ginger (optional)

## Method

1. Heat the milk in a small saucepan over medium heat until warm (do not boil).
2. Add turmeric powder and stir until well combined.
3. Add black pepper, cinnamon, and ginger if using, and stir.
4. Simmer gently for 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally.
5. Remove from heat and add honey or maple syrup if desired.
6. Strain through a fine mesh sieve if needed to remove any clumps.
7. Serve warm.

## Brain Health Notes

- Turmeric contains curcumin, a polyphenol with anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects.
- The fat in milk enhances curcumin absorption, as curcumin is fat-soluble.
- Black pepper contains piperine, which dramatically enhances curcumin bioavailability.
- Curcumin supports anti-inflammatory pathways and may help reduce neuroinflammation.
- This drink is part of food synergy strategies that enhance nutrient bioavailability.
