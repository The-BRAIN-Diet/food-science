## Overview

Turmeric milk combines turmeric (curcumin) with milk or plant-based milk. Curcumin is fat-soluble, so the fat in milk can improve its absorption; black pepper (piperine) is also associated with enhanced curcumin absorption. This warming drink is ideal for evening consumption.

## Ingredients

- 1 cup milk (dairy or plant-based)
- 1 tsp turmeric powder
- ½ tsp black pepper (optional, for enhanced absorption)
- 1 tsp honey or maple syrup (optional, for sweetness)
- ½ tsp ground cinnamon (optional)
- Pinch of ground ginger (optional)

## Method

1. Heat the milk in a small saucepan over medium heat until warm (do not boil).
2. Add turmeric powder and stir until well combined.
3. Add black pepper, cinnamon, and ginger if using, and stir.
4. Simmer gently for 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally.
5. Remove from heat and add honey or maple syrup if desired.
6. Strain through a fine mesh sieve if needed to remove any clumps.
7. Serve warm.

## Brain Health Notes

- **Turmeric** contains curcumin, a polyphenol studied for anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects.
- **Milk or plant-based milk** provides fat that can improve curcumin absorption, since curcumin is fat-soluble.
- **Black pepper** contains piperine, which is associated with enhanced curcumin bioavailability.
