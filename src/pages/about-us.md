# About Us

The BRAIN Diet (Bio Regulation Algorithm and Integrated Neuronutrition) is a systems-based nutrition framework designed to support brain health through evidence-informed dietary strategies.

## Our Story

<img src="/img/team/paul-houston.jpg" alt="Paul Houston" class="team-photo-square" />

The BRAIN Diet was created by Paul Houston to address the dysregulation of key biological systems that correlate highly with ADHD, including neurotransmitter balance, mitochondrial function, inflammation, gut–brain axis communication, methylation pathways, and oxidative stress. As it turned out, no surprise, a brain-focused diet for ADHD is a diet for all, including many other brain-related disorders. Much of the research overlapped with longevity research, Alzheimer's disease, and bipolar disorder research. 

Paul brings over 15 years of experience in clinical research, clinical study design, and medical data standards from his work at the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and CDISC (Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium). Paul has led projects creating data standards for medical research, including IDMP (Identification of Medicinal Products) and standards for therapeutic areas such as cancer and vaccines, while publishing articles in top scientific journals including BMJ, Oxford Academic, and Nature on medical research standards, open clinical research systems, and data sharing and anonymisation.

Paul's personal experience with ADHD and medical research standards background informs his commitment to evidence-based approaches to brain health and neurodivergence.

Having set up [Trials of Life](https://trialsoflife.net/) with Larry Callahan, PhD, Paul is now leveraging this extensive standards work to elevate the evidence base for alternative medicines and integrative health programs. The BRAIN Diet was the first project of [Trials of Life](https://trialsoflife.net/) and it was spun out as a separate company with a view to becoming a self-sustaining ecosystem of research, testing, and supporting products. Future clinical trials of the diet are in the pipeline (More to come on that soon...)

## Our Mission

Our mission is to provide accessible, science-based information about nutrition and its role in supporting cognitive function, emotional regulation, and overall brain health. We focus on translating complex research into practical dietary guidance that addresses key biological processes including:

- Neurotransmitter balance
- Mitochondrial function
- Inflammation modulation
- Gut–brain axis support

## Our Approach

The BRAIN Diet framework is developed in the context of research on ADHD, neurodevelopmental disorders, neurodegeneracy, and neurodivergence. We recognize that individual responses to dietary interventions vary, and our approach emphasizes:

- **Evidence-based**: Grounded in peer-reviewed research and scientific literature
- **Systems thinking**: Understanding the interconnected nature of biological processes
- **Individual variability**: Acknowledging that nutrition is not one-size-fits-all
- **Practical application**: Providing actionable guidance for real-world implementation

## Our Commitment

We are committed to:
- Maintaining scientific rigor in our content
- Continuously updating our knowledge base as new research emerges
- Providing transparent information about the evidence base for our recommendations
- Supporting individuals in making informed dietary choices

*The BRAIN Diet does not claim to deliver predetermined clinical effects. Our framework is informed by an evolving body of research, and its impact is evaluated empirically through observation and appropriately designed clinical studies.*
