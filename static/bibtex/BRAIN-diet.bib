	abstract = {Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder with high heterogeneity that can affect individuals of any age. It is characterized by three main symptoms: inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. These neurobehavioral alterations and neurochemical and pharmacological findings are mainly attributed to unbalanced catecholaminergic signaling, especially involving dopaminergic pathways within prefrontal and striatal areas. Dopamine receptors and transporters are not solely implicated in this imbalance, as evidence indicates that the dopaminergic signaling is modulated by adenosine activity. To this extent, alterations in adenosinergic signaling are probably involved in ADHD. Here, we review the current knowledge about adenosine’s role in the modulation of chemical, behavioral and cognitive parameters of ADHD, especially regarding dopaminergic signaling. Current literature usually links adenosine receptors signaling to the dopaminergic imbalance found in ADHD, but there is evidence that equilibrative nucleoside transporters (ENTs) could also be implicated as players in dopaminergic signaling alterations seen in ADHD, since their involvement in other neurobehavioral impairments.},

	abstract = {Background
Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder with complex genetic and environmental underpinnings. Emerging evidence suggests a significant role of gut microbiota in ADHD pathophysiology. This study investigates variations in gut microbiota composition and Short-Chain Fatty Acid (SCFA) profiles between children and adolescents with ADHD and healthy controls.
Methods
The study included 42 ADHD patients and 31 healthy controls, aged 6–18 years. Fecal samples were analyzed for microbial composition using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and for SCFA profiles through gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The study assessed both α and β diversity of gut microbiota and quantified various SCFAs to compare between the groups.
Results
ADHD subjects demonstrated significantly reduced gut microbiota diversity, as indicated by lower α-diversity indices (Shannon index, Observed species, Faith PD index) and a trend towards significance in β-diversity (Weighted UniFrac). Notably, the ADHD group exhibited significantly lower levels of key SCFAs, including acetic, propionic, isobutyric, isovaleric, and valeric acids, highlighting a distinct microbial and metabolic profile in these individuals.
Conclusion
This study uncovers significant alterations in gut microbiota and SCFA profiles in children with ADHD, compared to healthy controls. The observed changes in SCFAs, known for their associations with other behavioral and neurologic pathologies, and for their role in neural signaling. These findings offer a metabolite fingerprint that could potentially lead to novel diagnostic and treatment approaches for ADHD, emphasizing the importance of gut microbiota in the disorder’s pathogenesis and management.},

	abstract = {Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a persistent neurodevelopmental disorder that affects 5\% of children and adolescents and 2.5\% of adults worldwide. Throughout an individual's lifetime, ADHD can increase the risk of other psychiatric disorders, educational and occupational failure, accidents, criminality, social disability and addictions. No single risk factor is necessary or sufficient to cause ADHD. In most cases ADHD arises from several genetic and environmental risk factors that each have a small individual effect and act together to increase susceptibility. The multifactorial causation of ADHD is consistent with the heterogeneity of the disorder, which is shown by its extensive psychiatric co-morbidity, its multiple domains of neurocognitive impairment and the wide range of structural and functional brain anomalies associated with it. The diagnosis of ADHD is reliable and valid when evaluated with standard criteria for psychiatric disorders. Rating scales and clinical interviews facilitate diagnosis and aid screening. The expression of symptoms varies as a function of patient developmental stage and social and academic contexts. Although there are no curative treatments for ADHD, evidenced-based treatments can markedly reduce its symptoms and associated impairments. For example, medications are efficacious and normally well tolerated, and various non-pharmacological approaches are also valuable. Ongoing clinical and neurobiological research holds the promise of advancing diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to ADHD.

	abstract = {Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) persists in older age and is postulated as a risk factor for cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). However, these findings rely primarily on electronic health records and can present biased estimates of disease prevalence. An obstacle to investigating age-related cognitive decline in ADHD is the absence of large-scale studies following patients with ADHD into older age. Alternatively, this study aimed to determine whether genetic liability for ADHD, as measured by a well-validated ADHD polygenic risk score (ADHD-PRS), is associated with cognitive decline and the development of AD pathophysiology in cognitively unimpaired (CU) older adults. We calculated a weighted ADHD-PRS in 212 CU individuals without a clinical diagnosis of ADHD (55–90 years). These individuals had baseline amyloid-β (Aβ) positron emission tomography, longitudinal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) phosphorylated tau at threonine 181 (p-tau181), magnetic resonance imaging, and cognitive assessments for up to 6 years. Linear mixed-effects models were used to test the association of ADHD-PRS with cognition and AD biomarkers. Higher ADHD-PRS was associated with greater cognitive decline over 6 years. The combined effect between high ADHD-PRS and brain Aβ deposition on cognitive deterioration was more significant than each individually. Additionally, higher ADHD-PRS was associated with increased CSF p-tau181 levels and frontoparietal atrophy in CU Aβ-positive individuals. Our results suggest that genetic liability for ADHD is associated with cognitive deterioration and the development of AD pathophysiology. Findings were mostly observed in Aβ-positive individuals, suggesting that the genetic liability for ADHD increases susceptibility to the harmful effects of Aβ pathology.},

According to the energy substrate availability due to the diet quality and diet temporality, mitochondrial physiology is greatly affected. The present review article aimed to collect all the available information that has been published to date concerning the impact of five different popular diets (high-fat diet, ketogenic diet, fasting, caloric restriction diet and the Mediterranean diet) on specific mitochondrial physiological aspects, such as function, biogenesis, mitophagy and mitochondrial fission/fusion.},

	doi = {10.1016/S2215-0366(23)00332-2},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although often intended for long-term treatment, discontinuation of medication for ADHD is common. However, cross-national estimates of discontinuation are missing due to the absence of standardised measures. The aim of this study was to determine the rate of ADHD treatment discontinuation across the lifespan and to describe similarities and differences across countries to guide clinical practice.
METHODS: We did a retrospective, observational study using population-based databases from eight countries and one Special Administrative Region (Australia, Denmark, Hong Kong, Iceland, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, the UK, and the USA). We used a common analytical protocol approach and extracted prescription data to identify new users of ADHD medication. Eligible individuals were aged 3 years or older who had initiated ADHD medication between 2010 and 2020. We estimated treatment discontinuation and persistence in the 5 years after treatment initiation, stratified by age at initiation (children [age 4-11 years], adolescents [age 12-17 years], young adults [age 18-24 years], and adults [age ≥25 years]) and sex. Ethnicity data were not available.
FINDINGS: 1 229 972 individuals (735 503 [60\%] males, 494 469 females [40\%]; median age 8-21 years) were included in the study. Across countries, treatment discontinuation 1-5 years after initiation was lowest in children, and highest in young adults and adolescents. Within 1 year of initiation, 65\% (95\% CI 60-70) of children, 47\% (43-51) of adolescents, 39\% (36-42) of young adults, and 48\% (44-52) of adults remained on treatment. The proportion of patients discontinuing was highest between age 18 and 19 years. Treatment persistence for up to 5 years was higher across countries when accounting for reinitiation of medication; at 5 years of follow-up, 50-60\% of children and 30-40\% of adolescents and adults were covered by treatment in most countries. Patterns were similar across sex.
INTERPRETATION: Early medication discontinuation is prevalent in ADHD treatment, particularly among young adults. Although reinitiation of medication is common, treatment persistence in adolescents and young adults is lower than expected based on previous estimates of ADHD symptom persistence in these age groups. This study highlights the scope of medication treatment discontinuation and persistence in ADHD across the lifespan and provides new knowledge about long-term ADHD medication use.

This review summarizes the current research on the potential roles and mechanisms of SCFAs in AD. First, we introduce the metabolic distribution, specific receptors and signaling pathways of SCFAs in human body. The concentration levels of SCFAs in AD patient/animal models are then summarized. In addition, we illustrate the effects and mechanisms of SCFAs on the cognitive level, pathological features (Aβ and tau) and neuroinflammation in AD.

              To examine the association of protein intake from different sources with cognitive decline. 
             
             
              Methods 
              Our analysis included 3,083 participants aged 55–93 years from the China Health and Nutrition Survey. Cognition was assessed in 1997, 2000, 2004, 2006, and 2015. Diet intake was assessed using weighing methods in combination with 24-h dietary recalls for three consecutive days at each survey. 
             
             
              Results 
              Participants consumed 13.94\% of energy intake from total protein, with 11.47 and 2.47\% from plant and animal sources, respectively. During a follow-up of 9 years, participants in quintile 5 of plant protein intake (\% energy) had a higher risk [odds ratio (95\% CI): 3.03 (1.22–7.53)] of cognitive decline compared with those in quintile 1. Higher animal protein intake (\% total protein) was associated with a lower risk of cognitive decline [odds ratio (95\% CI) for quintile 5 vs. quintile 1: 0.22 (0.07–0.71)]. Grains (plant source) protein intake was inversely but fish/shrimp and poultry (animal source) protein intake were positively associated with change in cognitive Z-score. 
             
             
              Conclusion 
              Increasing animal protein consumption in a population with plant dominant diets may help to prevent cognitive decline.},

          There is little data on population-based identification of the gut microbiota with ADHD subtypes in children, yet whether the degree ADHD is characterized by short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) remains unclear. We enrolled 59 ADHD children including 21 inattentive subtypes (ADHD-I), 20 combined subtypes (ADHD-C), 18 hyperactive-Impulsive subtypes (ADHD-H) and 23 healthy controls. The microbiota was characterized by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and SCFA concentrations were determined by gas chromatographic analysis. Compared to the controls, we observed a decrease of 14 genera belonging to Ruminococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae, Verrucomicrobiaceae and Rikenellaceae family in ADHD-I, while Megamonas, Coprococcus\_2 and Paraprevotella were significantly increased in ADHD-C. In addition, a lower abundance of Faecalibacterium, and a higher proportion of Marvinbryantia, Intestinimonas, Prevotella\_9 and Eggerthella were detected in the ADHD-H. Analysis of fecal SCFAs showed that elevated levels of acetate and propionate were in ADHD subtypes. Furthermore, most of the bacterium associated with SCFAs overlapped with the differential bacterium in ADHD subtypes. Conclusion: Our data support the clinical distinction among different ADHD subtypes in children may also be reflected in alterations of specific gut microbiota, most of which are SCFA producing bacteria.},

	abstract = {Background
              Previous research has shown a significant link between gut microbiota in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention‐deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, much remains unknown because of the heterogeneity of disorders and the potential confounders such as dietary patterns and control group variations.
            
            
              Methods
              Children aged 6–12 years who had been clinically diagnosed with ASD and/or ADHD, their unaffected neurotypical siblings, and non‐related neurotypical volunteers were recruited cross‐sectionally. The ASD diagnosis was confirmed using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule‐2 (ADOS‐2) in all patients, including those with ADHD. Standardized DNA extraction and sequencing methods were used to compare gut microbial alpha‐diversity among the groups. Dietary diversity was calculated from a standardized dietary questionnaire form. We compared the difference in gut microbiome between patients with ASD and/or ADHD with neurotypical siblings and non‐related neurotypical controls.
            
            
              Results
              
                Ninety‐eight subjects were included in the study (18 with ASD, 19 with ADHD, 20 with both ASD and ADHD, 13 neurotypical siblings, and 28 non‐related neurotypical controls). The alpha‐diversity indices, such as Chao 1 and Shannon index, showed a significant difference between the groups in a Linear mixed‐effect model (
                F
                (4, 93) = 4.539,

                p
                 = .017), respectively. In a post‐hoc pairwise comparison, patients with ASD had lower alpha‐diversity compared with non‐related controls after Bonferroni correction. Dietary diversity shown in Shannon index did not differ among the groups (
                F
                (4, 84) = 1.494,
                p

              Conclusions
              Our study indicates disorder‐specific microbiome differences in patients with ASD. In future research on gut microbiota in neurodevelopmental disorders, it is necessary to consider the impact of ASD and ADHD co‐occurrence, and strictly control for background information such as diet, to elucidate the gut–microbiota interaction in ASD and ADHD for exploring the potential of therapeutic interventions.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Butyrate (BT) is a ubiquitous short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) principally derived from the enteric microbiome. BT positively modulates mitochondrial function, including enhancing oxidative phosphorylation and beta-oxidation and has been proposed as a neuroprotectant. BT and other SCFAs have also been associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), a condition associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. We have developed a lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) model of ASD, with a subset of LCLs demonstrating mitochondrial dysfunction (AD-A) and another subset of LCLs demonstrating normal mitochondrial function (AD-N). Given the positive modulation of BT on mitochondrial function, we hypothesized that BT would have a preferential positive effect on AD-A LCLs. To this end, we measured mitochondrial function in ASD and age-matched control (CNT) LCLs, all derived from boys, following 24 and 48 h exposure to BT (0, 0.1, 0.5, and 1 mM) both with and without an in vitro increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS). We also examined the expression of key genes involved in cellular and mitochondrial response to stress. In CNT LCLs, respiratory parameters linked to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production were attenuated by 1 mM BT. In contrast, BT significantly increased respiratory parameters linked to ATP production in AD-A LCLs but not in AD-N LCLs. In the context of ROS exposure, BT increased respiratory parameters linked to ATP production for all groups. BT was found to modulate individual LCL mitochondrial respiration to a common set-point, with this set-point slightly higher for the AD-A LCLs as compared to the other groups. The highest concentration of BT (1 mM) increased the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial fission (PINK1, DRP1, FIS1) and physiological stress (UCP2, mTOR, HIF1α, PGC1α) as well as genes thought to be linked to cognition and behavior (CREB1, CamKinase II). These data show that the enteric microbiome-derived SCFA BT modulates mitochondrial activity, with this modulation dependent on concentration, microenvironment redox state, and the underlying mitochondrial function of the cell. In general, these data suggest that BT can enhance mitochondrial function in the context of physiological stress and/or mitochondrial dysfunction, and may be an important metabolite that can help rescue energy metabolism during disease states. Thus, insight into this metabolic modulator may have wide applications for both health and disease since BT has been implicated in a wide variety of conditions including ASD. However, future clinical studies in humans are needed to help define the practical implications of these physiological findings.},

The incidence of NDDs in recent years has increased globally and the pathological mechanism is not fully understood. To date, plentiful evidence has showed that metabolic alterations associated with obesity and related issues such as neuroinflammation, oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction may represent an important risk factor, linking obesity and NDDs. Numerous studies have indicated a correlation between diet and brain activities. In this context, a key role is played by mitochondria located in the synaptic fraction; indeed, it has been shown that high-fat diets cause their dysfunction, affecting synaptic plasticity. In this scenario, the use of natural molecules that improve brain mitochondrial function represents an important therapeutic approach to treat NDDs. Recently, it was demonstrated that butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid is capable of counteracting obesity in an animal model, modulating mitochondrial function. The aim of this study has been to evaluate the effects of butyrate on neuroinflammatory state, oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in the brain cortex and in the synaptic fraction of a mouse model of diet-induced obesity. Our data have shown that butyrate partially reverts neuroinflammation and oxidative stress in the brain cortex and synaptic area, improving mitochondrial function and efficiency.},

	abstract = {In inflammatory neuropathies, oxidative stress results in neuronal and Schwann cell (SC) death promoting early neurodegeneration and clinical disability. Treatment with the short-chain fatty acid propionate showed a significant immunoregulatory and neuroprotective effect in multiple sclerosis patients. Similar effects have been described for patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). Therefore, Schwann cell's survival and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) outgrowth were evaluated in vitro after propionate treatment and application of H2O2 or S-nitroso-N-acetyl-D-L-penicillamine (SNAP) to evaluate neuroprotection. In addition, DRG resistance was evaluated by the application of oxidative stress by SNAP ex vivo after in vivo propionate treatment. Propionate treatment secondary to SNAP application on DRG served as a neuroregeneration model. Histone acetylation as well as expression of the free fatty acid receptor (FFAR) 2 and 3, histone deacetylases, neuroregeneration markers, and antioxidative mediators were investigated. β-hydroxybutyrate was used as a second FFAR3 ligand, and pertussis toxin was used as an FFAR3 antagonist. FFAR3, but not FFAR2, expression was evident on SC and DRG. Propionate-mediated activation of FFAR3 and histone 3 hyperacetylation resulted in increased catalase expression and increased resistance to oxidative stress. In addition, propionate treatment resulted in enhanced neuroregeneration with concomitant growth-associated protein 43 expression. We were able to demonstrate an antioxidative and neuroregenerative effect of propionate on SC and DRG mediated by FFAR3-induced histone acetylases expression. Our results describe a pathway to achieve neuroprotection/neuroregeneration relevant for patients with immune-mediated neuropathies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gut microbiota composition and function are symbiotically linked with host health and altered in metabolic, inflammatory and neurodegenerative disorders. Three recognised mechanisms exist by which the microbiome influences the gut-brain axis: modification of autonomic/sensorimotor connections, immune activation, and neuroendocrine pathway regulation. We hypothesised interactions between circulating gut-derived microbial metabolites, and the blood-brain barrier (BBB) also contribute to the gut-brain axis. Propionate, produced from dietary substrates by colonic bacteria, stimulates intestinal gluconeogenesis and is associated with reduced stress behaviours, but its potential endocrine role has not been addressed.
RESULTS: After demonstrating expression of the propionate receptor FFAR3 on human brain endothelium, we examined the impact of a physiologically relevant propionate concentration (1 μM) on BBB properties in vitro. Propionate inhibited pathways associated with non-specific microbial infections via a CD14-dependent mechanism, suppressed expression of LRP-1 and protected the BBB from oxidative stress via NRF2 (NFE2L2) signalling.
CONCLUSIONS: Together, these results suggest gut-derived microbial metabolites interact with the BBB, representing a fourth facet of the gut-brain axis that warrants further attention.},

This open-label, single-arm trial consisted of 30 children aged 4–16 years who met the criteria for ADHD diagnosis. Each subject took Bf-688, with one sachet in the morning and one in the evening (daily bacteria count 5 × 109 CFUs), for 8 weeks. Patients’ clinical symptoms were assessed using the Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham Rating Scale (SNAP-IV). We collected stool samples at the baseline, the 8th week, and the 12th week for gut microbiota examination. During the 8-week Bf-688 supplement period, patients’ inattention symptoms and hyperactivity/impulsive symptoms improved, and their weights and BMIs increased. For gut microbiota, the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio (F/B ratio) decreased significantly. LEfSe analysis revealed that Firmicutes significantly decreased while Proteobacteria significantly increased during the 8-week treatment period. After Bf-688 was discontinued for 4 weeks (12 weeks from baseline), Bacteroidota significantly decreased and Shigella significantly increased. The probiotic Bf-688 supplement was associated with an improvement of clinical symptoms and with weight gain among ADHD children. Furthermore, gut microbiota composition was significantly altered by the Bf-688 supplement. A future randomized control trial is warranted to verify these findings.},

Two types of sourdough were used in this study: quinoa sourdough fermented with L. plantarum ATCC 8014 and quinoa sourdough spontaneous fermented. The first one influenced the chemical composition of muffins in terms of decreased content of carbohydrates, higher amounts of both organic acids and folic acid. Furthermore, higher amounts of flavonoids, total phenols and increased radical scavenging activity were recorded due to the use of Lactobacillus plantarum ATCC 8014 strain.

A case-study of the history of dietary fat science and recommendations is presented, summarizing presentations from an Experimental Biology Symposium that addressed techniques for effective scientific communication and used the scientific discourse of public understanding of dietary fats and health as an example of challenges in scientific communication. Decades of dietary recommendations have focused on balancing calorie intake and energy expenditure and decreasing fat. Reducing saturated fat has been a cornerstone of dietary recommendations for cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk reduction. However, evidence from observational studies and randomized clinical trials demonstrates that replacing saturated fat with carbohydrates, specifically refined, has no benefit on CVD risk, while substituting polyunsaturated fats for either saturated fat or carbohydrate reduces risk. A significant body of research supports the unique health benefits of dietary patterns and foods that contain plant and marine sources of unsaturated fats. Yet, after decades of focus on low-fat diets, many consumers, food manufacturers, and restauranteurs remain confused about the role of dietary fats on disease risk and sources of healthy fats. Shifting dietary recommendations to focus on food-based dietary patterns would facilitate translation to the public and potentially remedy widespread misperceptions about what constitutes a healthful dietary pattern.},

The effect sizes (ES) were synthesized by using a random-effects model. In the 19 studies on cortisol levels (totaling n = 916 youth with ADHD and n = 947 typically developing (TD), healthy youth), youth with ADHD have lower basal cortisol levels at any time-points during the day (effect size: .68; p = 0.004) and lower cumulative levels of cortisol (ES: .39, p = .008) throughout the day than TD youth. Moreover, morning cortisol levels were lower in ADHD youth when compared with TD youth (14 studies, n = 1679, ES: .84, p = 0.003), while there is no difference for the afternoon cortisol levels (p = 0.48). The meta-analysis on inflammation biomarker was conducted on 4 studies (totaling n = 404 youth) showed that Tumour Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α) was lower in ADHD when compared with TD (3 studies, n = 257 youth, p = 0.004), while no differences for Interleukin-1β(IL-1β) (p = 0.21), IL-6 (p = 0.09) and IL-10 (p = 0.77).

This review summarizes the current research on the potential roles and mechanisms of SCFAs in AD. First, we introduce the metabolic distribution, specific receptors and signaling pathways of SCFAs in human body. The concentration levels of SCFAs in AD patient/animal models are then summarized. In addition, we illustrate the effects and mechanisms of SCFAs on the cognitive level, pathological features (Aβ and tau) and neuroinflammation in AD. Finally, we analyze the translational value of SCFAs as potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of AD.},

However, these findings rely primarily on electronic health records and can present biased estimates of disease prevalence. An obstacle to investigating age-related cognitive decline in ADHD is the absence of large-scale studies following patients with ADHD into older age. Alternatively, this study aimed to determine whether genetic liability for ADHD, as measured by a well-validated ADHD polygenic risk score (ADHD-PRS), is associated with cognitive decline and the development of AD pathophysiology in cognitively unimpaired (CU) older adults. We calculated a weighted ADHD-PRS in 212 CU individuals without a clinical diagnosis of ADHD (55–90 years). These individuals had baseline amyloid-β (Aβ) positron emission tomography, longitudinal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) phosphorylated tau at threonine 181 (p-tau181), magnetic resonance imaging, and cognitive assessments for up to 6 years. Linear mixed-effects models were used to test the association of ADHD-PRS with cognition and AD biomarkers. Higher ADHD-PRS was associated with greater cognitive decline over 6 years. The combined effect between high ADHD-PRS and brain Aβ deposition on cognitive deterioration was more significant than each individually. Additionally, higher ADHD-PRS was associated with increased CSF p-tau181 levels and frontoparietal atrophy in CU Aβ-positive individuals. Our results suggest that genetic liability for ADHD is associated with cognitive deterioration and the development of AD pathophysiology. Findings were mostly observed in Aβ-positive individuals, suggesting that the genetic liability for ADHD increases susceptibility to the harmful effects of Aβ pathology.},

Throughout an individual's lifetime, ADHD can increase the risk of other psychiatric disorders, educational and occupational failure, accidents, criminality, social disability and addictions. No single risk factor is necessary or sufficient to cause ADHD. In most cases ADHD arises from several genetic and environmental risk factors that each have a small individual effect and act together to increase susceptibility. The multifactorial causation of ADHD is consistent with the heterogeneity of the disorder, which is shown by its extensive psychiatric co-morbidity, its multiple domains of neurocognitive impairment and the wide range of structural and functional brain anomalies associated with it. The diagnosis of ADHD is reliable and valid when evaluated with standard criteria for psychiatric disorders. Rating scales and clinical interviews facilitate diagnosis and aid screening. The expression of symptoms varies as a function of patient developmental stage and social and academic contexts. Although there are no curative treatments for ADHD, evidenced-based treatments can markedly reduce its symptoms and associated impairments. For example, medications are efficacious and normally well tolerated, and various non-pharmacological approaches are also valuable. Ongoing clinical and neurobiological research holds the promise of advancing diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to ADHD.

Each subject took Bf-688, with one sachet in the morning and one in the evening (daily bacteria count 5 × 109 CFUs), for 8 weeks. Patients’ clinical symptoms were assessed using the Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham Rating Scale (SNAP-IV). We collected stool samples at the baseline, the 8th week, and the 12th week for gut microbiota examination. During the 8-week Bf-688 supplement period, patients’ inattention symptoms and hyperactivity/impulsive symptoms improved, and their weights and BMIs increased. For gut microbiota, the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio (F/B ratio) decreased significantly. LEfSe analysis revealed that Firmicutes significantly decreased while Proteobacteria significantly increased during the 8-week treatment period. After Bf-688 was discontinued for 4 weeks (12 weeks from baseline), Bacteroidota significantly decreased and Shigella significantly increased. The probiotic Bf-688 supplement was associated with an improvement of clinical symptoms and with weight gain among ADHD children. Furthermore, gut microbiota composition was significantly altered by the Bf-688 supplement. A future randomized control trial is warranted to verify these findings.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gut microbiota composition and function are symbiotically linked with host health and altered in metabolic, inflammatory and neurodegenerative disorders. Three recognised mechanisms exist by which the microbiome influences the gut-brain axis: modification of autonomic/sensorimotor connections, immune activation, and neuroendocrine pathway regulation. We hypothesised interactions between circulating gut-derived microbial metabolites, and the blood-brain barrier (BBB) also contribute to the gut-brain axis. Propionate, produced from dietary substrates by colonic bacteria, stimulates intestinal gluconeogenesis and is associated with reduced stress behaviours, but its potential endocrine role has not been addressed.
RESULTS: After demonstrating expression of the propionate receptor FFAR3 on human brain endothelium, we examined the impact of a physiologically relevant propionate concentration (1 μM) on BBB properties in vitro. Propionate inhibited pathways associated with non-specific microbial infections via a CD14-dependent mechanism, suppressed expression of LRP-1 and protected the BBB from oxidative stress via NRF2 (NFE2L2) signalling.
CONCLUSIONS: Together, these results suggest gut-derived microbial metabolites interact with the BBB, representing a fourth facet of the gut-brain axis that warrants further attention.},

The incidence of NDDs in recent years has increased globally and the pathological mechanism is not fully understood. To date, plentiful evidence has showed that metabolic alterations associated with obesity and related issues such as neuroinflammation, oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction may represent an important risk factor, linking obesity and NDDs. Numerous studies have indicated a correlation between diet and brain activities. In this context, a key role is played by mitochondria located in the synaptic fraction; indeed, it has been shown that high-fat diets cause their dysfunction, affecting synaptic plasticity. In this scenario, the use of natural molecules that improve brain mitochondrial function represents an important therapeutic approach to treat NDDs. Recently, it was demonstrated that butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid is capable of counteracting obesity in an animal model, modulating mitochondrial function. The aim of this study has been to evaluate the effects of butyrate on neuroinflammatory state, oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in the brain cortex and in the synaptic fraction of a mouse model of diet-induced obesity. Our data have shown that butyrate partially reverts neuroinflammation and oxidative stress in the brain cortex and synaptic area, improving mitochondrial function and efficiency.},

Treatment with the short-chain fatty acid propionate showed a significant immunoregulatory and neuroprotective effect in multiple sclerosis patients. Similar effects have been described for patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). Therefore, Schwann cell's survival and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) outgrowth were evaluated in vitro after propionate treatment and application of H2O2 or S-nitroso-N-acetyl-D-L-penicillamine (SNAP) to evaluate neuroprotection. In addition, DRG resistance was evaluated by the application of oxidative stress by SNAP ex vivo after in vivo propionate treatment. Propionate treatment secondary to SNAP application on DRG served as a neuroregeneration model. Histone acetylation as well as expression of the free fatty acid receptor (FFAR) 2 and 3, histone deacetylases, neuroregeneration markers, and antioxidative mediators were investigated. β-hydroxybutyrate was used as a second FFAR3 ligand, and pertussis toxin was used as an FFAR3 antagonist. FFAR3, but not FFAR2, expression was evident on SC and DRG. Propionate-mediated activation of FFAR3 and histone 3 hyperacetylation resulted in increased catalase expression and increased resistance to oxidative stress. In addition, propionate treatment resulted in enhanced neuroregeneration with concomitant growth-associated protein 43 expression. We were able to demonstrate an antioxidative and neuroregenerative effect of propionate on SC and DRG mediated by FFAR3-induced histone acetylases expression.

	abstract = {Abstract
            Butyrate (BT) is a ubiquitous short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) principally derived from the enteric microbiome. BT positively modulates mitochondrial function, including enhancing oxidative phosphorylation and beta-oxidation and has been proposed as a neuroprotectant. BT and other SCFAs have also been associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), a condition associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. We have developed a lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) model of ASD, with a subset of LCLs demonstrating mitochondrial dysfunction (AD-A) and another subset of LCLs demonstrating normal mitochondrial function (AD-N). Given the positive modulation of BT on mitochondrial function, we hypothesized that BT would have a preferential positive effect on AD-A LCLs. To this end, we measured mitochondrial function in ASD and age-matched control (CNT) LCLs, all derived from boys, following 24 and 48 h exposure to BT (0, 0.1, 0.5, and 1 mM) both with and without an in vitro increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS). We also examined the expression of key genes involved in cellular and mitochondrial response to stress. In CNT LCLs, respiratory parameters linked to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production were attenuated by 1 mM BT. In contrast, BT significantly increased respiratory parameters linked to ATP production in AD-A LCLs but not in AD-N LCLs. In the context of ROS exposure, BT increased respiratory parameters linked to ATP production for all groups. BT was found to modulate individual LCL mitochondrial respiration to a common set-point, with this set-point slightly higher for the AD-A LCLs as compared to the other groups. The highest concentration of BT (1 mM) increased the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial fission (PINK1, DRP1, FIS1) and physiological stress (UCP2, mTOR, HIF1α, PGC1α) as well as genes thought to be linked to cognition and behavior (CREB1, CamKinase II). These data show that the enteric microbiome-derived SCFA BT modulates mitochondrial activity, with this modulation dependent on concentration, microenvironment redox state, and the underlying mitochondrial function of the cell. In general, these data suggest that BT can enhance mitochondrial function in the context of physiological stress and/or mitochondrial dysfunction, and may be an important metabolite that can help rescue energy metabolism during disease states. Thus, insight into this metabolic modulator may have wide applications for both health and disease since BT has been implicated in a wide variety of conditions including ASD. However, future clinical studies in humans are needed to help define the practical implications of these physiological findings.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          There is little data on population-based identification of the gut microbiota with ADHD subtypes in children, yet whether the degree ADHD is characterized by short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) remains unclear. We enrolled 59 ADHD children including 21 inattentive subtypes (ADHD-I), 20 combined subtypes (ADHD-C), 18 hyperactive-Impulsive subtypes (ADHD-H) and 23 healthy controls. The microbiota was characterized by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and SCFA concentrations were determined by gas chromatographic analysis. Compared to the controls, we observed a decrease of 14 genera belonging to Ruminococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae, Verrucomicrobiaceae and Rikenellaceae family in ADHD-I, while Megamonas, Coprococcus\_2 and Paraprevotella were significantly increased in ADHD-C. In addition, a lower abundance of Faecalibacterium, and a higher proportion of Marvinbryantia, Intestinimonas, Prevotella\_9 and Eggerthella were detected in the ADHD-H. Analysis of fecal SCFAs showed that elevated levels of acetate and propionate were in ADHD subtypes. Furthermore, most of the bacterium associated with SCFAs overlapped with the differential bacterium in ADHD subtypes. Conclusion: Our data support the clinical distinction among different ADHD subtypes in children may also be reflected in alterations of specific gut microbiota, most of which are SCFA producing bacteria.},

	abstract = {Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder diagnosed with hyperactivity, impulsivity, and a lack of attention inconsistent with the patient’s development level. The fact that people with ADHD frequently experience gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction highlights the possibility that the gut microbiome may play a role in this condition. The proposed research aims to determine a biomarker for ADHD by reconstructing a model of the gut-microbial community. Genome-scale metabolic models (GEM) considering the relationship between gene-protein-reaction associations are used to simulate metabolic activities in organisms of gut. The production rates of dopamine and serotonin precursors and the key short chain fatty acids which affect the health status are determined under three diets (Western, Atkins’, Vegan) and compared with those of healthy people. Elasticities are calculated to understand the sensitivity of exchange fluxes to changes in diet and bacterial abundance at the species level. The presence of Bacillota (genus Coprococcus and Subdoligranulum), Actinobacteria (genus Collinsella), Bacteroidetes (genus Bacteroides), and Bacteroidota (genus Alistipes) may be possible gut microbiota indicators of ADHD. This type of modeling approach taking microbial genome-environment interactions into account helps us understand the gastrointestinal mechanisms behind ADHD, and establish a path to improve the quality of life of ADHD patients.},

Nevertheless, their function is easily adaptable as regards the energy demands and the availability of chemical substrates. This allows cells to buffer sudden changes and reassure cellular metabolism, growth or survival. Currently, humans have different dietary habits, which provide several stimuli to the cell. According to the energy substrate availability due to the diet quality and diet temporality, mitochondrial physiology is greatly affected. The present review article aimed to collect all the available information that has been published to date concerning the impact of five different popular diets (high-fat diet, ketogenic diet, fasting, caloric restriction diet and the Mediterranean diet) on specific mitochondrial physiological aspects, such as function, biogenesis, mitophagy and mitochondrial fission/fusion.},

Children with ADHD who were already receiving a stable dose of methylphenidate (MPH) treatment were enrolled and were randomly assigned to two groups: one receiving add-on Bf-688 (daily bacterial count of 5 × 109 CFUs) (n = 51) and the other receiving a placebo (n = 51). All participants underwent assessments using Conners’ Continuous Performance Test (CPT) and Conners’ Continuous Auditory Test of Attention (CATA). Additionally, fecal samples were collected at the beginning of the trial (week 0) and at the endpoint (week 12). Remarkably, the group receiving Bf-688 supplementation, but not the placebo group, exhibited significant improvements in omission errors in CPT as well as Hit reaction time in both CPT and CATA. Gut microbiome analysis revealed a significant increase in the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio (F/B ratio) only in the Bf-688 group. Furthermore, we identified significant negative correlations between N-Glycan biosynthesis and Hit reaction time in both CPT and CATA. Our results demonstrate that the probiotic Bf-688 supplement can enhance neuropsychological performance in children with ADHD, possibly by altering the composition of the gut microbiota, ultimately leading to reduced N-Glycan biosynthesis.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Diabetes mellitus is one of the most common causes of chronic kidney disease. Kidney involvement in patients with diabetes has a wide spectrum of clinical presentations ranging from asymptomatic to overt proteinuria and kidney failure. The development of kidney disease in diabetes is associated with structural changes in multiple kidney compartments, such as the vascular system and glomeruli. Glomerular alterations include thickening of the glomerular basement membrane, loss of podocytes, and segmental mesangiolysis, which may lead to microaneurysms and the development of pathognomonic Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodules. Beyond lesions directly related to diabetes, awareness of the possible coexistence of nondiabetic kidney disease in patients with diabetes is increasing. These nondiabetic lesions include focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, IgA nephropathy, and other primary or secondary renal disorders. Differential diagnosis of these conditions is crucial in guiding clinical management and therapeutic approaches. However, the relationship between diabetes and the kidney is bidirectional; thus, new-onset diabetes may also occur as a complication of the treatment in patients with renal diseases. Here, we review the complex and multifaceted correlation between diabetes and kidney diseases and discuss clinical presentation and course, differential diagnosis, and therapeutic oppor-tunities offered by novel drugs.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Sleep is an essential component of physical and emotional well-being, and lack, or disruption, of sleep due to insomnia is a highly prevalent problem. The interest in complementary and alternative medicines for treating or preventing insomnia has increased recently. Centuries-old herbal treatments, popular for their safety and effectiveness, include valerian, passionflower, lemon balm, lavender, and Californian poppy. These herbal medicines have been shown to reduce sleep latency and increase subjective and objective measures of sleep quality. Research into their molecular components revealed that their sedative and sleep-promoting properties rely on interactions with various neurotransmitter systems in the brain. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is an inhibitory neurotransmitter that plays a major role in controlling different vigilance states. GABA receptors are the targets of many pharmacological treatments for insomnia, such as benzodiazepines. Here, we perform a systematic analysis of studies assessing the mechanisms of action of various herbal medicines on different subtypes of GABA receptors in the context of sleep control. Currently available evidence suggests that herbal extracts may exert some of their hypnotic and anxiolytic activity through interacting with GABA receptors and modulating GABAergic signaling in the brain, but their mechanism of action in the treatment of insomnia is not completely understood.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: Dopamine, a key neurotransmitter in the autonomic nervous system participating in the homeostatic balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions, is involved in food intake regulation. Objective: We investigated whether dopamine is altered by acute fasting or overfeeding diets with varying macronutrient content. Design: Ninety-nine healthy subjects underwent 24-h dietary interventions including eucaloric feeding, fasting, and five different overfeeding diets in a crossover design. Overfeeding diets (200\% of eucaloric requirements) included one diet with 3\%-protein (low-protein high-fat overfeeding—LPF: 46\%-fat), three diets with 20\%-protein, and a diet with 30\%-protein (44\%-fat). Urine was collected for 24 h and urinary dopamine concentration was quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography. Plasma pancreatic polypeptide (PP) concentration, an indirect marker of parasympathetic activity, was measured prior to and after each diet after an overnight fast. Results: During 24-h of fasting, dopamine decreased on average by {\textasciitilde}14\% compared to eucaloric conditions, whereas PP increased by two-fold (both p \&lt; 0.001). Lower dopamine during 24-h fasting correlated with increased PP (r = −0.40, p \&lt; 0.001). Similarly, on average urinary dopamine decreased during LPF by 14\% (p \&lt; 0.001) and lower dopamine correlated with increased PP (r = −0.31, p = 0.01). No changes in dopamine and PP concentrations were observed during other overfeeding diets (all p \&gt; 0.05). Conclusions: Dopamine concentrations decrease during short-term fasting and overfeeding with a low-protein diet. As both dietary conditions have in common protein deficit, the correlation between dopamine and PP suggests a compensatory mechanism underlying the shift from sympathetic to parasympathetic drive during dietary protein deprivation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}DHA (docosahexaenoic acid, C22:6,n−3) has been shown to promote neurite growth and synaptogenesis in embryonic hippocampal neurons, supporting the importance of DHA known for hippocampus-related learning and memory function. In the present study, we demonstrate that DHA metabolism to DEA (N-docosahexaenoylethanolamide) is a significant mechanism for hippocampal neuronal development, contributing to synaptic function. We found that a fatty acid amide hydrolase inhibitor URB597 potentiates DHA-induced neurite growth, synaptogenesis and synaptic protein expression. Active metabolism of DHA to DEA was observed in embryonic day 18 hippocampal neuronal cultures, which was increased further by URB597. Synthetic DEA promoted hippocampal neurite growth and synaptogenesis at substantially lower concentrations in comparison with DHA. DEA-treated neurons increased the expression of synapsins and glutamate receptor subunits and exhibited enhanced glutamatergic synaptic activity, as was the case for DHA. The DEA level in mouse fetal hippocampi was altered according to the maternal dietary supply of n–3 fatty acids, suggesting that DEA formation is a relevant in vivo process responding to the DHA status. In conclusion, DHA metabolism to DEA is a significant biochemical mechanism for neurite growth, synaptogenesis and synaptic protein expression, leading to enhanced glutamatergic synaptic function. The novel DEA-dependent mechanism offers a new molecular insight into hippocampal neurodevelopment and function.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In neuropsychiatry, progressive integration of dietary approaches in clinical routine made it necessary to discern the more about some of these dietary NTs. Relevant books and literature from PubMed and Scopus databases were searched for data on food sources of Ach, glutamate, GABA, dopamine, 5-HT, and histamine. Different animal foods, fruits, edible plants, roots, and botanicals were reported to contain NTs. These substances can either be naturally present, as part of essential metabolic processes and ecological interactions, or derive from controlled/uncontrolled food technology processes. Ripening time, methods of preservation and cooking, and microbial activity further contributes to NTs. Moreover, gut microbiota are considerable sources of NTs. However, the significance of dietary NTs intake needs to be further investigated as there are no significant data on their bioavailability, neuronal/non neuronal effects, or clinical implications.

NTs control numerous organic functions particularly crucial for life, including movement, emotional responses, and the physical ability to feel pleasure and pain. These molecules are synthesized from simple, very common precursors. Many types of NTs have both excitatory and inhibitory effects. Neurotransmitters’ imbalance can cause many diseases and disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease, depression, insomnia, increased anxiety, memory loss, etc. Natural food sources containing NTs and/or their precursors would be a potential option to help maintain the balance of NTs to prevent brain and psychiatric disorders. The level of NTs could be influenced, therefore, by targeting dietary habits and nutritional regimens. The progressive implementation of nutritional approaches in clinical practice has made it necessary to infer more about some of the nutritional NTs in neuropsychiatry. However, the importance of the intake of nutritional NTs requires further understanding, since there are no prior significant studies about their bioavailability, clinical significance, and effects on nerve cells.

This review aims to shed light on the potential influence of the microbiome on the development of the most prevalent neurodevelopmental disease, attention-deficit-hyperactive disorder (ADHD). As the etiology and pathophysiology of ADHD are still unclear, finding viable biomarkers and effective treatment still represent a challenge. Therefore, we focused on factors that have been associated with a higher risk of developing ADHD, while simultaneously influencing the microbial composition. We reviewed the effect of a differing microbial makeup on neurotransmitter concentrations important in the pathophysiology of ADHD. Additionally, we deduced factors that correlate with a high prevalence of ADHD, while simultaneously affecting the gut microbiome, such as emergency c-sections, and premature birth as the former leads to a decrease of the gut microbial diversity and the latter causes neuroprotective Lactobacillus levels to be reduced. Also, we assessed nutritional influences, such as breastfeeding, ingestion of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on the host′s microbiome and development of ADHD. Finally, we discussed the potential significance of Bifidobacterium as a biomarker for ADHD, the importance of preventing premature birth as prophylaxis and nutrition as a prospective therapeutic measurement against ADHD.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} There is increasing, but largely indirect, evidence pointing to an effect of commensal gut microbiota on the central nervous system (CNS). However, it is unknown whether lactic acid bacteria such as {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Lactobacillus rhamnosus{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} could have a direct effect on neurotransmitter receptors in the CNS in normal, healthy animals. GABA is the main CNS inhibitory neurotransmitter and is significantly involved in regulating many physiological and psychological processes. Alterations in central GABA receptor expression are implicated in the pathogenesis of anxiety and depression, which are highly comorbid with functional bowel disorders. In this work, we show that chronic treatment with {\textless}italic{\textgreater}L. rhamnosus{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} ( {\textless}italic{\textgreater}JB-1{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} ) induced region-dependent alterations in GABA $_{\textrm{B1b}}$ mRNA in the brain with increases in cortical regions (cingulate and prelimbic) and concomitant reductions in expression in the hippocampus, amygdala, and {\textless}italic{\textgreater}locus coeruleus{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} , in comparison with control-fed mice. In addition, {\textless}italic{\textgreater}L. rhamnosus{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} ( {\textless}italic{\textgreater}JB-1{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} ) reduced GABA $_{\textrm{Aα2}}$ mRNA expression in the prefrontal cortex and amygdala, but increased GABA $_{\textrm{Aα2}}$ in the hippocampus. Importantly, {\textless}italic{\textgreater}L. rhamnosus{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} ( {\textless}italic{\textgreater}JB-1{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} ) reduced stress-induced corticosterone and anxiety- and depression-related behavior. Moreover, the neurochemical and behavioral effects were not found in vagotomized mice, identifying the vagus as a major modulatory constitutive communication pathway between the bacteria exposed to the gut and the brain. Together, these findings highlight the important role of bacteria in the bidirectional communication of the gut–brain axis and suggest that certain organisms may prove to be useful therapeutic adjuncts in stress-related disorders such as anxiety and depression. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We enrolled 216 children with ADHD and 216 age-, height- and gender-matched controls from 31 elementary schools in Taiwan. Dietary intake of the participants was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Fasting blood samples were collected to determine the serum levels of multiple nutritional markers. Moreover, we employed a structural equation model (SEM) to link diet, nutritional markers and ADHD. Compared to healthy control, ADHD children had significantly lower serum levels of vitamin B12, folate, vitamin B6, ferritin concentration, and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), but higher levels of serum saturated fatty acids (SFA), n-6/n-3 fatty acid ratio, and inorganic phosphorous concentration. Children with ADHD had more intake of nutrient-poor foods such as high sugar and high fat foods, and had less intake of vegetable, fruit, protein-rich foods than their counterpart. SEM analysis showed that the poor nutritional biochemistry profiles linked the association between unhealthy dietary patterns and ADHD. In conclusion, an unhealthy dietary pattern may be a predecessor of the poor nutritional biochemistry status, and managing diet and nutrition conditions should be considered to improve ADHD symptoms in children.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Given the role of B group vitamins in cell metabolism, synthesis of nucleotides, and neurotransmitters, the present study systematically investigated the plasma levels of vitamins B $_{\textrm{9}}$ and B $_{\textrm{12}}$ in children with ADHD. Methods: We searched electronic databases including Web of Science, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, Iran MEDEX, Cochran database, and SID from conception to June 2023. Full-text case-control or cross-sectional studies were included in this study. Participants in the case group were children with ADHD aged 6–12 years. Review Manager Software (RevMan 5.4) was used for statistical analyses. Standardized mean differences (SMD) with 95\% CIs were used to determine the differences between the two groups. Results: Six studies were included in the present meta-analysis. They included 982 children, of whom, 204 were girls and 744 were boys. The mean age of the children was 8.86±2.03 years. The level of vitamin B $_{\textrm{9}}$ was significantly different between children with and without ADHD [SMD –0.80, 95\% CI (–1.55, –0.04)]. Vitamin B $_{\textrm{12}}$ was significantly lower in children with ADHD [SMD –0.29, 95\% CI (–0.42, –0.16)]. However, due to high heterogeneity (I $^{\textrm{2}}$ = 93\%), sensitivity analysis was used, I $^{\textrm{2}}$ fell to 21\%, and significant difference was observed between the two groups [SMD –0.19, 95\% CI (–0.34, −0.04)]. Conclusion: The results of this systematic review showed that the level of vitamins B $_{\textrm{9}}$ and B $_{\textrm{12}}$ in children with ADHD was significantly lower than that in healthy children. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The ketogenic diet (KD) is a popular option for managing body weight, though its influence on glucose and lipid metabolism was still inconclusive. Gut microbiota is modulated by dietary pattens and has been associated with the changes of metabolic homeostasis induced by KD. Here, we found that two types of KDs, KD1 (8.8\% carbohydrate, 73.4\% fat, 17.9\% protein, 5.7 kcal/g) and KD2 (0.4\% carbohydrate, 93.2\% fat, 6.4\% protein, 6.7 kcal/g), induced changes of gut microbiota and its metabolites, contributing to glucose intolerance but not lipid accumulation in mice. Following a 2-week intervention with KDs, mice fed on KD1 displayed symptoms related to obesity, whereas KD2-fed mice exhibited a decrease in body weight but had severe hepatic lipid accumulation and abnormal fatty acid metabolism, while both KDs led to significant glucose intolerance. Compared to the mice fed on a standard chow diet, the conventional mice fed on both KD1 and KD2 had significant shifted gut microbiota, lower levels of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and composition alteration of cecal bile acids. By using an antibiotic cocktail (ABX) to deplete most of the gut microbiota in mice, we found the disturbances induced by KDs in lipid metabolism were similar in the ABX-treated mice to their conventional companions, but the disturbances in glucose metabolism were absent in the ABX-treated mice. In conclusion, these findings suggest that ketogenic diets disrupted glucose and lipid metabolism, at least in mice, and highlight the gut microbial culprits associated with KD induced glucose intolerance rather than lipid accumulation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} Normal brain functioning relies on high aerobic energy production provided by mitochondria. Failure to supply a sufficient amount of energy, seen in different brain disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), may have a significant negative impact on brain development and support of different brain functions. Mitochondrial dysfunction, manifested in the abnormal activities of the electron transport chain and impaired energy metabolism, greatly contributes to ASD. The aberrant functioning of this organelle is of such high importance that ASD has been proposed as a mitochondrial disease. It should be noted that aerobic energy production is not the only function of the mitochondria. In particular, these organelles are involved in the regulation of Ca $^{\textrm{2+}}$ homeostasis, different mechanisms of programmed cell death, autophagy, and reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS) production. Several syndromes originated from mitochondria-related mutations display ASD phenotype. Abnormalities in Ca $^{\textrm{2+}}$ handling and ATP production in the brain mitochondria affect synaptic transmission, plasticity, and synaptic development, contributing to ASD. ROS and Ca $^{\textrm{2+}}$ regulate the activity of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP). The prolonged opening of this pore affects the redox state of the mitochondria, impairs oxidative phosphorylation, and activates apoptosis, ultimately leading to cell death. A dysregulation between the enhanced mitochondria-related processes of apoptosis and the inhibited autophagy leads to the accumulation of toxic products in the brains of individuals with ASD. Although many mitochondria-related mechanisms still have to be investigated, and whether they are the cause or consequence of this disorder is still unknown, the accumulating data show that the breakdown of any of the mitochondrial functions may contribute to abnormal brain development leading to ASD. In this review, we discuss the multifaceted role of mitochondria in ASD from the various aspects of neuroscience. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

This review presents scientific findings supporting dietary antioxidant treatment of ADHD and describes substantial alterations in the immune system, epigenetic regulation of gene expression, and oxidative stress regulation in ADHD. As a result, chronic inflammation and oxidative stress could develop, which can lead to ADHD symptoms, for example by chronic T-cell-mediated neuroinflammation, as well as by neuronal oxidative damage and loss of normal cerebral functions. Therefore, modulation of immune system activity and oxidant-antioxidant balance using nutritional approaches might have potential in ADHD treatment. The use of natural antioxidants against oxidative conditions is an emerging field in the management of neurodegenerative diseases. Dietary polyphenols, for example, have antioxidant capacities as well as immunoregulatory effects and, therefore, appear appropriate in ADHD therapy. This review can stimulate the development and investigation of dietary antioxidant treatment in ADHD, which is highly desired.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In this study, we were interested in three molecules or classes of molecules present in chicory root: fructose, chlorogenic acids, and sesquiterpene lactones. We conducted experiments on the murine model and performed a nutrigenomic analysis, a metabolic hormone assay and a gut microbiota analysis, associated with in vitro observations for different responses. We have highlighted a large number of effects of all these classes of molecules that suggest a pro-apoptotic activity, an anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antioxidant, hypolipidemic and hypoglycemic effect and also an important role in appetite regulation. A significant prebiotic activity was also identified. Fructose seems to be the most involved in these activities, contributing to approximately 83\% of recorded responses, but the other classes of tested molecules have shown a specific role for these different effects, with an estimated contribution of 23–24\%.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} In many cells, ATP-sensitive K $^{\textrm{+}}$ channels (K $_{\textrm{ATP}}$ channels) couple metabolic state to excitability. In pancreatic beta cells, for example, this coupling regulates insulin release. Although K $_{\textrm{ATP}}$ channels are abundantly expressed in the brain, their physiological role and the factors that regulate them are poorly understood. One potential regulator is H $_{\textrm{2}}$ O $_{\textrm{2}}$ . We reported previously that dopamine (DA) release in the striatum is modulated by endogenous H $_{\textrm{2}}$ O $_{\textrm{2}}$ , generated downstream from glutamatergic α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)-receptor activation. Here we investigated whether H $_{\textrm{2}}$ O $_{\textrm{2}}$ -sensitive K $_{\textrm{ATP}}$ channels contribute to DA-release modulation by glutamate and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). This question is important because DA–glutamate interactions underlie brain functions, including motor control and cognition. Synaptic DA release was evoked by using local electrical stimulation in slices of guinea pig striatum and monitored in real time with carbon-fiber microelectrodes and fast-scan cyclic voltammetry. The K $_{\textrm{ATP}}$ -channel antagonist glibenclamide abolished the H $_{\textrm{2}}$ O $_{\textrm{2}}$ -dependent increase in DA release usually seen with AMPA-receptor blockade by GYKI-52466 [1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-5 {\textless}italic{\textgreater}H{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} -2,3-benzodiazepine hydrochloride] and the decrease in DA release seen with GABA-type-A-receptor blockade by picrotoxin. In contrast, 5-hydroxydecanoate, a mitochondrial K $_{\textrm{ATP}}$ -channel blocker, was ineffective, as were sulpiride, a D $_{\textrm{2}}$ -receptor antagonist, and tertiapin, a G protein-coupled K $^{\textrm{+}}$ -channel inhibitor. Diazoxide, a sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1)selective K $_{\textrm{ATP}}$ -channel opener, prevented DA modulation by H $_{\textrm{2}}$ O $_{\textrm{2}}$ , glutamate, and GABA, whereas cromakalim, a SUR2-selective opener, did not. Thus, endogenous H $_{\textrm{2}}$ O $_{\textrm{2}}$ activates SUR1-containing K $_{\textrm{ATP}}$ channels in the plasma membrane to inhibit DA release. These data not only demonstrate that K $_{\textrm{ATP}}$ channels can modulate CNS transmitter release in response to fast-synaptic transmission but also introduce H $_{\textrm{2}}$ O $_{\textrm{2}}$ as a K $_{\textrm{ATP}}$ -channel regulator. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Quercetin is one of a broad group of natural polyphenolic flavonoid substances that are being investigated for their widespread health benefits. These benefits have generally been ascribed to its combination of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity, but recent in vitro evidence suggests that improved mitochondrial biogenesis could play an important role. In addition, the in vivo effects of quercetin on mitochondrial biogenesis exercise tolerance are unknown. We examined the effects of 7 days of quercetin feedings in mice on markers of mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscle and brain, and on endurance exercise tolerance. Mice were randomly assigned to one of the following three treatment groups: placebo, 12.5 mg/kg quercetin, or 25 mg/kg quercetin. Following 7 days of treatment, mice were killed, and soleus muscle and brain were analyzed for mRNA expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator (PGC-1α) and sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and cytochrome c. Additional mice underwent a treadmill performance run to fatigue or were placed in voluntary activity wheel cages, and their voluntary activity (distance, time, and peak speed) was recorded. Quercetin increased mRNA expression of PGC-1α and SIRT1 ( P \&lt; 0.05), mtDNA ( P \&lt; 0.05) and cytochrome c concentration ( P \&lt; 0.05). These changes in markers of mitochondrial biogenesis were associated with an increase in both maximal endurance capacity ( P \&lt; 0.05) and voluntary wheel-running activity ( P \&lt; 0.05). These benefits of querectin on fitness without exercise training may have important implications for enhancement of athletic and military performance and may also extend to prevention and/or treatment of chronic diseases.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In this review, we summarize the efficacy of genistein in attenuating the effects of memory impairment (MI) in animals. Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science databases were used to find the relevant articles and discuss the effects of genistein in the brain, including its pharmacokinetics, bioavailability, behavioral effects, and some of the potential mechanisms of action on memory in several animal models. The results of the preclinical studies highly suggested that genistein is highly effective in enhancing the cognitive performance of the MI animal models, specifically in the memory domain, including spatial, recognition, retention, and reference memories, through its ability to reduce oxidative stress and attenuate neuroinflammation. This review also highlighted challenges and opportunities to improve the drug delivery of genistein for treating MI. Along with that, the possible structural modifications and derivatives of genistein to improve its physicochemical and drug-likeness properties are also discussed. The outcomes of the review proved that genistein can enhance the cognitive performance and ameliorate MI in different preclinical studies, thus indicating its potential as a natural lead for the design and development of a novel neuroprotective drug.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Speer allergic tension-fatigue syndrome (SATFS) is a classic allergy syndrome characterized by allergy-like symptoms, muscle tension, headaches, chronic fatigue, and other particular behaviors that were initially described in the fifties. The particular behaviors displayed include symptoms such as hyperkinesis, hyperesthesia (i.e., insomnia), restlessness, and distractibility, among others. Interestingly, these symptoms are very similar to descriptions of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), the most prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder worldwide, which is characterized by inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. The clinical description of SATFS precedes the nomination of ADHD in 1960 by Stella Chess. In this conceptual paper, we stress that there is a gap in the research on the relationship between ADHD and allergic pathologies. The hypotheses of this conceptual paper are (1) SATFS is probably one of the first and best historical descriptions of ADHD alongside a common comorbidity (allergy) displayed by these patients; (2) SATFS (ADHD) is a systemic disease that includes both somatic and behavioral manifestations that may influence each other in a bidirectional manner; (3) The role of neuroinflammation and histamine is key for understanding the pathophysiology of ADHD and its frequent somatic comorbidities; (4) The deficiency of the diamine oxidase (DAO) enzyme, which metabolizes histamine extracellularly, may play a role in the pathophysiology of ADHD. Decreased DAO activity may lead to an accumulation of histamine, which could contribute to core ADHD symptoms and comorbid disorders. Further empirical studies are needed to confirm our hypotheses.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Neurodevelopmental disorders appear to be rising in prevalence, according to the recent Global Burden of Disease Study. This rise is likely to be multi-factorial, but the role of certain nutrients known to facilitate neurodevelopment should be considered. One possible contributing factor could be attributed to deficits in choline intake, particularly during key stages of neurodevelopment, which includes the first 1000 days of life and childhood. Choline, a key micronutrient, is crucial for optimal neurodevelopment and brain functioning of offspring. The present narrative review discusses the main research, describing the effect of choline in neurodevelopmental disorders, to better understand its role in the etiology and management of these disorders. In terms of findings, low choline intakes and reduced or altered choline status have been reported in relevant population subgroups: pregnancy (in utero), children with autism spectrum disorders, people with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and those with dyslexia. In conclusion, an optimal choline provision may offer some neuronal protection in early life and help to mitigate some cognitive effects in later life attributed to neurodevelopmental conditions. Research indicates that choline may act as a modifiable risk factor for certain neurodevelopmental conditions. Ongoing research is needed to unravel the mechanisms and explanations.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In nervous system disorders, taurine has a broader role, showing protective activity against toxicity in different neurodegenerative disease models for Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and Huntington's diseases [[13], [14], [15]]. Molecular investigations have shown that it may be a neuroprotectant against stroke [16]. It reduced oxidative stress-induced neuropathy in a diabetic mouse model by activating antioxidative defense signals [17]. In addition, recent studies have shown the pharmacological potential of taurine against neurodevelopmental disorders. It protected against retinoic acid-mediated neural tube defects in a mouse model and ameliorated hyperactive behavior in spontaneously hypertensive rats [18,19]. In this article, we describe the molecular mechanistic role of taurine in various neurological disorders, mainly focusing on recent advances from pharmacological perspectives.

Here we critically review evidence collected during the past 40-plus years supporting the role of dopamine dysfunction in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We recapitulate the basic components of dopaminergic signaling in the central nervous system, focusing on core enzymes, transporters and receptors involved in monoaminergic functions, particularly in striatal and cortical regions. We summarize key human brain imaging and genetic studies reporting associations between dopaminergic neurotransmission and behavioral traits, with an emphasis on ADHD. We also consider ADHD in the context of animal models and single gene, metabolic, and neurological disorders with established dysfunction of the dopaminergic system. Examining the evidence in this way leads us to conclude that there is evidence for the involvement of dopamine but limited evidence for a hypo-dopaminergic state {\textless}italic{\textgreater}per se{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} as a key component of ADHD.

Other researchers underline that neuronutrition includes the use of various nutrients and diets to prevent and treat neurological disorders. The aim of this narrative review was to explore the current understanding of the term neuronutrition as the key concept for brain health, its potential molecular targets, and perspectives of its nutritional approach to the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, multiple sclerosis, anxiety, depressive disorders, migraine, and chronic pain. Neuronutrition can be defined as a part of neuroscience that studies the influence of various aspects of nutrition (nutrients, diet, eating behavior, food environment, etc.) on the development of nervous disorders and includes nutrition, clinical dietetics, and neurology. There is evidence that the neuronutritional approach can influence neuroepigenetic modifications, immunological regulation, metabolic control, and behavioral patterns. The main molecular targets in neuronutrition include neuroinflammation, oxidative/nitrosative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, gut–brain axis disturbance, and neurotransmitter imbalance. To effectively apply neuronutrition for maintaining brain health, a personalized approach is needed, which includes the adaptation of the scientific findings to the genetic, biochemical, psycho-physiological, and environmental features of each individual.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Chelation therapy, the conventional treatment for heavy metal toxicity, is reported to have a number of safety and efficacy issues. Recent studies have shown that dietary supplements play important roles in protecting against Cd and Pb toxicity. This paper reviews the evidence for protective effects of essential metals, vitamins, edible plants, phytochemicals, probiotics and other dietary supplements against Cd and Pb toxicity and describes the proposed possible mechanisms. Based on these findings, dietary strategies are recommended for people at risk of Cd and Pb exposure. The application of these strategies is advantageous for both the prevention and alleviation of Cd and Pb toxicity, as such supplements can be added easily and affordably to the daily diet and are expected to have very few side effects compared to the chelation therapy.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

A 36-week unicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 65 ME/CFS patients, who were randomly allocated to one of two arms to receive four capsules each one of 250 mg beta-glucan, 3.75 µg vitamin D3, 1.05 mg vitamin B6, and 7.5 mg zinc (n = 35), or matching placebo including only microcrystalline cellulose as an excipient (n = 30) once daily. The findings showed that the beta-glucan supplementation significantly improved cognitive fatigue (assessed with FIS-40 scores) after the 36-week treatment compared to the baseline (p = 0.0338). Taken together, this study presents the novel finding that yeast-derived beta-glucan may alleviate cognitive fatigue symptoms in ME/CFS. Thus, it offers valuable scientific insights into the potential use of yeast beta-glucan as a nutritional supplement and/or functional food to prevent or reduce cognitive dysfunction in patients with ME/CFS. Further interventions are warranted to validate these findings and also to delve deeper into the possible immunometabolic pathomechanisms of beta-glucans in ME/CFS.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

However, few studies have investigated glutamate in the brain of adults with ADHD naive to stimulant medication. Therefore, we used [1H]MRS to measure the combined signal of glutamate and glutamine (Glu+Gln; abbreviated as Glx) along with other neurometabolites such as creatine (Cr), N-acetylaspartate (NAA) and choline. Data were acquired from three brain regions, including two implicated in ADHD—the basal ganglia (caudate/striatum) and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)—and one ‘control’ region—the medial parietal cortex. We compared 40 adults with ADHD, of whom 24 were naive for ADHD medication, whereas 16 were currently on stimulants, against 20 age, sex and IQ-matched healthy controls. We found that compared with controls, adult ADHD participants had a significantly lower concentration of Glx, Cr and NAA in the basal ganglia and Cr in the DLPFC, after correction for multiple comparisons. There were no differences between stimulant-treated and treatment-naive ADHD participants. In people with untreated ADHD, lower basal ganglia Glx was significantly associated with more severe symptoms of inattention. There were no significant differences in the parietal ‘control’ region. We suggest that subcortical glutamate and glutamine have a modulatory role in ADHD adults; and that differences in glutamate–glutamine levels are not explained by use of stimulant medication. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The cholinergic system plays a significant role in neuroimmune communication, transmitting information regarding the peripheral immune status to the central nervous system (CNS) and vice versa. The cholinergic system includes the neurotransmitter{\textbackslash} molecule, acetylcholine (ACh), cholinergic receptors (AChRs), choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) enzyme, and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzyme. These molecules are involved in regulating immune response and playing a crucial role in maintaining homeostasis. Most innate and adaptive immune cells respond to neuronal inputs by releasing or expressing these molecules on their surfaces. Dysregulation of this neuroimmune communication may lead to several inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Several agonists, antagonists, and inhibitors have been developed to target the cholinergic system to control inflammation in different tissues. This review discusses how various molecules of the neuronal and non-neuronal cholinergic system (NNCS) interact with the immune cells. What are the agonists and antagonists that alter the cholinergic system, and how are these molecules modulate inflammation and immunity.

There is a high demand to find biomarkers for the diagnosis of ADHD. The aim of this study is to analyze the serum profiles of several biomarkers, including homocysteine (Hcy), vitamin B12, vitamin D, ferritin, and iron, in a cohort of 133 male subjects (6.5–12.5 years), including 67 individuals with an ADHD diagnosis based on DSM-V criteria and 66 age-matched healthy boys (healthy controls, HC). Assessments for ADHD included the Iowa Conners’ Teacher Rating Scale (CPRS) and the ADHDT test, as well as cognitive assessments using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised (WISC-R) and the TROG-2 language comprehension test. Hcy and iron were quantified using spectrophotometry, while vitamin B12 and total 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels were determined using an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) and ferritin was measured using a particle-enhanced immunoturbidimetric assay. The results showed significantly increased Hcy levels and decreased vitamin B12 levels in ADHD patients compared to HCs. Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that Hcy is a potential prognostic indicator for ADHD.

A recent consensus statement renewed the importance and the role of high levels of homocysteine in cognitive decline in several forms of degenerative dementia, such as Alzheimer’s disease. Although the molecular mechanisms by which homocysteine causes cell dysfunction are known, both the impact of homocysteine on specific cognitive functions and the relationship between homocysteine level and non-Alzheimer dementias have been poorly investigated. Most of the studies addressing the impact of hyperhomocysteinemia on dementias have not examined the profile of performance across different cognitive domains, and have only relied on screening tests, which provide a very general and coarse-grained picture of the cognitive status of the patients. Yet, trying to understand whether hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with the impairment of specific cognitive functions would be crucial, as it would be, in parallel, learning whether some brain circuits are particularly susceptible to the damage caused by hyperhomocysteinemia. These steps would allow one to (i) understand the actual role of homocysteine in the pathogenesis of cognitive decline and (ii) improve the diagnostic accuracy, differential diagnosis and prognostic implications.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}A randomized trial (VITACOG) in people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) found that B vitamin treatment to lower homocysteine slowed the rate of cognitive and clinical decline. We have used data from this trial to see whether baseline omega-3 fatty acid status interacts with the effects of B vitamin treatment. 266 participants with MCI aged ≥70 years were randomized to B vitamins (folic acid, vitamins B6 and B12) or placebo for 2 years. Baseline cognitive test performance, clinical dementia rating (CDR) scale, and plasma concentrations of total homocysteine, total docosahexaenoic and eicosapentaenoic acids (omega-3 fatty acids) were measured. Final scores for verbal delayed recall, global cognition, and CDR sum-of-boxes were better in the B vitamin-treated group according to increasing baseline concentrations of omega-3 fatty acids, whereas scores in the placebo group were similar across these concentrations. Among those with good omega-3 status, 33\% of those on B vitamin treatment had global CDR scores \&gt;0 compared with 59\% among those on placebo. For all three outcome measures, higher concentrations of docosahexaenoic acid alone significantly enhanced the cognitive effects of B vitamins, while eicosapentaenoic acid appeared less effective. When omega-3 fatty acid concentrations are low, B vitamin treatment has no effect on cognitive decline in MCI, but when omega-3 levels are in the upper normal range, B vitamins interact to slow cognitive decline. A clinical trial of B vitamins combined with omega-3 fatty acids is needed to see whether it is possible to slow the conversion from MCI to AD.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Objective: We investigated whether ADHD children who are positive to Purkinje cell antibodies display pro-inflammatory activity associated with high cytokine serum levels. Method: Fifty-eight ADHD outpatients were compared with 36 healthy, age- and sex-matched children. Forty-five of the ADHD children were positive to anti-Yo antibodies, whereas 34 of the control children were negative. Interleukin 4 (IL-4), IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), and interferon gamma (IFNγ) cytokine serum levels were tested in ADHD children who were positive to anti-Yo antibodies and in the control children who were negative. Results: Anti-Yo antibodies were present to a greater extent in the ADHD group: 77.58\% versus 22.42\%. Significant differences emerged between the two groups in IL-6 and IL-10, with higher cytokine levels being detected in ADHD children than in controls. Conclusion: Immune processes in ADHD are likely to be associated with mediators of inflammation, such as cytokines. These results contribute to our understanding of action of neural antibodies and cytokines in ADHD.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders in childhood, affecting {\textasciitilde}7\% of children and adolescents. Given its adverse health outcomes and high healthcare and societal costs, other treatment options beyond pharmacotherapy have been explored. Case-control studies have shown that dietary patterns may influence the risk of ADHD, and specific dietary interventions have been proposed as coadjuvant treatments in this disorder. These include nutritional supplements, gut microbiome-targeted interventions with biotics, and elimination diets. The purpose of this review is to examine which dietary patterns are most associated with ADHD and to summarize the existing evidence for the clinical use of dietary interventions. The literature showed that non-healthy dietary patterns were positively associated with ADHD, whereas healthy patterns were negatively associated. As for nutritional supplements, only vitamin D and vitamin D + magnesium appeared to improve ADHD symptoms when baseline levels of vitamin D were insufficient/deficient. Regarding biotics, evidence was only found for Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and for multi-species probiotic supplementation. Elimination diets have scarce evidence and lead to nutritional deficiencies, so caution is advised. Overall, more robust scientific evidence is required for these dietary interventions to be implemented as part of ADHD therapy.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} Although endogenous cannabinoid systems have been implicated in the modulation of the rewarding effects of abused drugs and food, little is known about the direct effects of endogenous ligands for cannabinoid receptors on brain reward processes. Here we show for the first time that the intravenous administration of anandamide, an endogenous ligand for cannabinoid receptors, and its longer‐lasting synthetic analog methanandamide, increase the extracellular dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens shell of awake, freely moving rats, an effect characteristic of most drugs abused by humans. Anandamide produced two distinctly different effects on dopamine levels: (1) a rapid, transient increase that was blocked by the cannabinoid CB $_{\textrm{1}}$ receptor antagonist rimonabant, but not by the vanilloid VR $_{\textrm{1}}$ receptor antagonist capsazepine, and was magnified and prolonged by the fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) enzyme inhibitor, URB597; (2) a smaller delayed and long‐lasting increase, not sensitive to CB $_{\textrm{1}}$ , VR $_{\textrm{1}}$ or FAAH blockade. Both effects were blocked by infusing either tetrodotoxin (TTX, 1 µ \textsc{m} ) or calcium‐free Ringer's solution through the microdialysis probe, demonstrating that they were dependent on the physiologic activation of dopaminergic neurotransmission. Thus, these results indicate that anandamide, through the activation of the mesolimbic dopaminergic system, participates in the signaling of brain reward processes. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Although less well characterized than serine/threonine kinases, tyrosine kinases are also concentrated in the synapse. The effect of genistein, a selective inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity, was examined on the in vitro release of endogenous dopamine (DA) from superfused mouse striatal slices. Fractional release of DA was significantly increased over basal release levels by genistein (100 and 200 µ {\textless}italic{\textgreater}M{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} ). The effect was concentration dependent and rapidly reversible on washout of the kinase inhibitor. No significant change from basal release levels was observed with two structural analogues of genistein that do not inhibit tyrosine kinase activity at the same concentration. We have previously described alterations in basal and evoked DA release from the striatum of the weaver ( {\textless}italic{\textgreater}wv/wv{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} ) mutant mouse, and genotypic differences in fractional release were also observed with genistein stimulation. The total evoked release was 25–50\% greater from the {\textless}italic{\textgreater}wv/wv{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} striatum. These results suggest a modulatory role for tyrosine kinase activity in neurotransmitter release and perhaps an alteration of kinase‐regulated mechanisms in the DA‐deficient {\textless}italic{\textgreater}wv/wv{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} striatum. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) is marketed in the U.S. as a dietary supplement. USP conducted a comprehensive safety evaluation of GABA by assessing clinical studies, adverse event information, and toxicology data. Clinical studies investigated the effect of pure GABA as a dietary supplement or as a natural constituent of fermented milk or soy matrices. Data showed no serious adverse events associated with GABA at intakes up to 18 g/d for 4 days and in longer studies at intakes of 120 mg/d for 12 weeks. Some studies showed that GABA was associated with a transient and moderate drop in blood pressure (\&lt;10\% change). No studies were available on effects of GABA during pregnancy and lactation, and no case reports or spontaneous adverse events associated with GABA were found. Chronic administration of GABA to rats and dogs at doses up to 1 g/kg/day showed no signs of toxicity. Because some studies showed that GABA was associated with decreases in blood pressure, it is conceivable that concurrent use of GABA with anti-hypertensive medications could increase risk of hypotension. Caution is advised for pregnant and lactating women since GABA can affect neurotransmitters and the endocrine system, i.e., increases in growth hormone and prolactin levels.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

This study explored whether elevated levels of inflammation-sensitive plasma proteins (ISPs) (fibrinogen, orosomucoid, α1-antitrypsin, haptoglobin, and ceruloplasmin) are associated with future weight gain. Five ISPs were measured in 2,821 nondiabetic healthy men (38-50 years of age) who were reexamined after a mean follow-up of 6.1 years. Future weight gain was studied in relation to the number of elevated ISPs (i.e., in the top quartile). The proportion with a large weight gain (75th percentile ≥3.8 kg) was 21.0, 25.9, 26.8, and 28.3\%, respectively, among men with none, one, two, and three or more ISPs in the top quartile (P for trend 0.0005). This relation remained significant after adjustments for weight at baseline, follow-up time, height (at baseline and follow-up), physical inactivity (at baseline and follow-up), smoking (at baseline and follow-up), high alcohol consumption, and insulin resistance. The relations were largely similar for all individual ISPs. Elevated ISP levels predict a large weight gain in middle-aged men. This relation could contribute to the relation between inflammation, the metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease.},

It is a known source of highly bioavailable omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid). In preclinical studies, krill oil showed metabolic, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective and chemo preventive effects, while in clinical trials it showed significant metabolic, vascular and ergogenic actions. Solvent extraction is the most conventional method to obtain krill oil. However, different solvents must be used to extract all lipids from krill because of the diversity of the polarities of the lipid compounds in the biomass. This review aims to provide an overview of the chemical composition, bioavailability and bioaccessibility of krill oil, as well as the mechanisms of action, classic and non-conventional extraction techniques, health benefits and current applications of this marine crustacean.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Excessive local inflammation is a common mechanism in many cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) such as hypertension, atherosclerosis and aortic aneurysms. In endothelial cells, inflammatory cytokines such as interferons, tumour necrosis factor alpha or interleukins increase oxidative stress and contractile prostanoids and the expression of adhesion molecules that reduce nitric oxide (NO) availability and bind leucocytes, thereby impairing endothelial function. Despite this evidence, anti‐inflammatory therapies are not yet indicated for the treatment of most CVD. Resolution of inflammation is mediated by a family of specialized pro‐resolving mediators (SPMs) that act on cognate G protein–coupled receptors to limit immune cell infiltration and initiate tissue repair. SPMs, generated from omega‐3 and omega‐6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, belong to four major families: lipoxins, resolvins, protectins and maresins. SPM receptors are expressed in immune and vascular cells where they regulate important processes such as phagocytosis and polarization, production of cytokines, NO and prostacyclin, and modulation of smooth muscle cell phenotype. Growing evidence in animal models demonstrates that activation of SPM receptors can protect vascular function and structure and provide beneficial effects in various CVD. We will review recent advances in the role of inflammation and SPMs in vascular (dys)function in hypertension, atherosclerosis, and aortic aneurysms.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Only a few studies assessing the sleep effects of low doses of melatonin (aMT) have been performed in the past, most of them in adults, and only one in subjects with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The aim of this study was to provide evidence of the changes induced by aMT doses as low as 1 mg in the sleep pattern of pediatric patients with ADHD under treatment with methylphenidate (MPH). Methods. Children and adolescents (7–15 years) with ADHD who were receiving extended-release MPH were recruited. A seven-week sleep diary was collected prior to starting a four-week treatment with 1 mg of aMT (30 min before bedtime). Seven-day actigraphic assessments of sleep were performed before and after treatment. Results. Twenty-seven patients (17 males, 62.96\%) participated in the study, who had been receiving MPH for 1.57 (1.11) months. A significant increase in sleep duration (TST) was observed after one month of treatment (463 (49) min to 485 (41) min; p \&lt; 0.040), with nonsignificant improvements in sleep-onset latency (SOL), nocturnal awakenings, or sleep efficiency. Only minor adverse effects were reported. Conclusion. Low doses of melatonin (1 mg) are able to increase TST in children and adolescents with ADHD receiving treatment with psychostimulants, with an adequate tolerability profile. Further placebo-controlled trials adjusting the time of aMT administration to the individual circadian profile should explore the effects of low doses of this hormone to shorten SOL in this population of patients.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We find significant associations with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism diagnoses. We validate the ADHD findings in three large, independent mother–child cohorts (n = 59,725, n = 656 and n = 348) through self-reported dietary modelling, maternal blood metabolomics and foetal blood metabolomics. Metabolome analyses identify 15 mediating metabolites in pregnancy that improve ADHD prediction. Longitudinal blood metabolome analyses, incorporating five time points per cohort in two independent cohorts, reveal that associations between western dietary pattern metabolite scores and neurodevelopmental outcomes are consistently significant in early–mid-pregnancy. These findings highlight the potential for targeted prenatal dietary interventions to prevent neurodevelopmental disorders and emphasise the importance of early intervention.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The ketogenic diet (KD) is recognized as minimum carbohydrate and maximum fat intakes, which leads to ketosis stimulation, a state that is thought to metabolize fat more than carbohydrates for energy supply. KD has gained more interest in recent years and is for many purposes, including weight loss and managing serious diseases like type 2 diabetes. On the other hand, many believe that KD has safety issues and are uncertain about the health drawbacks. Thus, the outcomes of the effect of KD on metabolic and non‐metabolic disease remain disputable. The current narrative review aims to evaluate the effect of KD on several diseases concerning the human health. To our best knowledge, the first report aims to investigate the efficacy of KD on multiple human health issues including type 2 diabetes and weight loss, cardiovascular disease, kidney failure and hypertension, non‐alcoholic fatty liver, mental problem, oral health, libido, and osteoporosis. The literature searches were performed in Databases, PubMed, Scopus, and web of Science looking for both animal and human model designs. The results heterogeneity seems to be explained by differences in diet composition and duration. Also, the available findings may show that proper control of carbohydrates, a significant reduction in glycemic control and glycated hemoglobin, and weight loss by KD can be an approach to improve diabetes and obesity, hypertension, non‐alcoholic fatty liver, PCOS, libido, oral health, and mental problem if isocaloric is considered. However, for some other diseases like cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis, more robust data are needed. Therefore, there is robust data to support the notion that KD can be effective for some metabolic and non‐metabolic diseases but not for all of them. So they have to be followed cautiously and under the supervision of health professionals.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In this review, we examine the protein and amino acid intakes from vegetarian diets followed by adults in western countries and gather information in terms of adequacy for protein and amino acids requirements, using indirect and direct data to estimate nutritional status. We point out that protein-rich foods, such as traditional legumes, nuts and seeds, are sufficient to achieve full protein adequacy in adults consuming vegetarian/vegan diets, while the question of any amino acid deficiency has been substantially overstated. Our review addresses the adequacy in changes to protein patterns in people newly transitioning to vegetarian diets. We also specifically address this in older adults, where the issues linked to the protein adequacy of vegetarian diets are more complex. This contrasts with the situation in children where there are no specific concerns regarding protein adequacy because of their very high energy requirements compared to those of protein. Given the growing shifts in recommendations from nutrition health professionals for people to transition to more plant-based, whole-food diets, additional scientific evidence-based communications confirming the protein adequacy of vegetarian and vegan diets is warranted.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We also argue that subtle changes in the composition of the membrane’s fatty acids may lead to down-stream effects causing dysregulation of the membrane, cytoskeleton and their interface. Such exquisite sensitivity to minor changes is known to occur in physical systems undergoing phase transitions, the simplest and most studied of them is the so-called Ising model, which exhibits a phase transition at a finite temperature between an ordered and disordered state in 2- or 3-dimensional space. We propose this model in the context of neuronal dynamics and further hypothesize that it may involve quantum degrees of freedom dependent upon variation in membrane domains associated with ion channels or microtubules. Finally, we provide a link between these physical characteristics of the dynamical mechanism to psychiatric disorders such as major depression and antidepressant action.},

The core symptoms include pervasive inattention and inappropriate levels of hyperactivity-impulsivity. High-frequency gamma activity has been implicated in the temporal binding of stimulus properties across cortical areas, and is known to be crucial for complex information processing and attentional processes in particular. Thus, we evaluated the amplitude of gamma-frequency neural responses in adults with and those without ADHD, and tested whether stimulant medications, the most common treatment for ADHD, modulate gamma activity in affected adults. Participants underwent two sessions ({\textasciitilde}75 min apart) of auditory stimulation using stimuli known to elicit 40 Hz gamma-band responses as magnetoencephalography data were acquired. Between sessions, the ADHD group (who were in maintenance therapy) were administered their daily stimulant medication and both groups were told to relax. The primary results indicated that gamma activity was weaker in the ADHD group during session one (pre-drug), but not session two (post-drug), and that gamma activity significantly increased following stimulant administration in adults with ADHD. These results suggest that ADHD is associated with reduced cortical gamma activity and that stimulants may ameliorate this abnormality.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {We describe a new molecular mechanism of dopamine-induced membrane protein modulation that can tune neuronal oscillation frequency to attention-related gamma rhythm. This mechanism is based on the unique ability of D4 dopamine receptors (D4R) to carry out phospholipid methylation (PLM) that may affect the kinetics of ion channels. We show that by deceasing the inertia of the delayed rectifier potassium channel, a transition to 40 Hz oscillations can be achieved. Decreased potassium channel inertia shortens spike duration and decreases the interspike interval via its influence on the calcium-dependent potassium current. This mechanism leads to a transition to attention-related gamma oscillations in a pyramidal cell-interneuron network. The higher frequency and better synchronization is observed with PLM affecting pyramidal neurons only, and recurrent excitation between pyramidal neurons is important for synchronization. Thus dopamine-stimulated methylation of membrane phospholipids may be an important mechanism for modulating firing activity, while impaired methylation can contribute to disorders of attention.},

	abstract = {Objectives
The objective was to examine the prospective association of major dietary protein sources with all-cause and cause-specific mortality in U.S. women.
Methods
We included 127,495 postmenopausal women aged 50 to 79 years old at study entry who were enrolled between 1993 and 1998 in the Women’s Health Initiative from September 1993, and followed through February 2017. Prospective cohort study. We used multivariable Cox proportional hazards models to estimate adjusted HRs of all cause, cardiovascular, cancer and dementia mortality in relation to major protein sources.
Results
During 2,302,230 person-years of follow-up, 35,043 deaths occurred. Total protein or animal protein intake was not significantly associated with all-cause or cause-specific mortality. Plant protein intake was inversely associated with all-cause, CVD and dementia mortality, with multivariable-adjusted HRs (95\% CIs), comparing the higher with the lowest quintile, as 0.91 (0.86, 0.95), 0.87 (0.79, 0.95), and 0.81 (0.70, 0.94), respectively. Substituting 5\% energy from animal protein with plant protein was associated with a 13\% lower risk of all-cause mortality. For major protein sources, consumption of unprocessed red meat, processed red meat, and eggs, was associated with higher risk of all-cause mortality, with multivariable-adjusted HRs (95\% CIs), comparing the higher with the lowest quintile, as 1.07 (1.03, 1.11), 1.07 (1.03, 1.11), and 1.14 (1.10, 1.18), respectively, while nut consumption was associated with a slightly lower risk of all-cause mortality, with multivariable-adjusted HRs (95\% CIs), comparing the higher with the lowest quintile, as 0.97 (0.93, 0.99). Substituting 4 ounce equivalent/day of total red meat with poultry, fish/shellfish, or nuts, was associated with a 8\%, a 12\%, and a 12\% lower risk of all-cause mortality, respectively.
Conclusions
Different dietary protein sources have varying associations with lower all-cause, CVD and dementia mortality. Substituting total red meat with poultry, fish/shellfish, or nuts was associated with lower risk of all-cause mortality.

The classic saturated fatty acid-enriched (SAT) KD has a fat:carbohydrate plus protein ratio of 4:1, in which the predominant fats are saturated. We hypothesized that a polyunsaturated fat-enriched (POLY) KD would induce a similar degree of ketosis with less detrimental effects on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Twenty healthy adults were randomized to two different weight-maintaining KDs for 5 d. Diets were 70\% fat, 15\% carbohydrate, and 15\% protein. The fat contents were 60 or 15\% saturated, 15 or 60\% polyunsaturated, and 25\% monounsaturated for SAT and POLY, respectively. Changes in serum β-hydroxybutyrate, insulin sensitivity (SI), and lipid profiles were measured. Mean circulating β-hydroxybutyrate levels increased 8.4 mg/dl in the POLY group (P = 0.0004), compared with 3.1 mg/dl in the SAT group (P = 0.07). SI increased significantly in the POLY group (P = 0.02), whereas total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased significantly in the SAT group (both P = 0.002). These data demonstrate that a short-term POLY KD induces a greater level of ketosis and improves SI, without adversely affecting total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, compared with a traditional SAT KD. Thus, a POLY KD may be superior to a classical SAT KD for chronic administration.},

Omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids, particularly eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are crucial food components that may modulate the function of this axis through molecular mechanisms. Derived mainly from marine sources, these long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids are integral to cell membrane structure, enhancing fluidity and influencing neurotransmitter function and signal transduction. Additionally, n-3 fatty acids modulate inflammation by altering eicosanoid production, reducing proinflammatory cytokines, and promoting anti-inflammatory mediators. These actions help preserve the integrity of cellular barriers like the intestinal and blood–brain barriers. In the CNS, EPA and DHA support neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, and neurotransmission, improving cognitive functions. They also regulate the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis by reducing excessive cortisol production, associated with stress responses and mental health disorders. Furthermore, n-3 fatty acids influence the composition and function of the gut microbiota, promoting beneficial bacterial populations abundance that contribute to gut health and improve systemic immunity. Their multifaceted roles within the GBA underscore their significance in maintaining homeostasis and supporting mental well-being.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Here we review studies of the endocannabinoid system in humans with psychotic and mood disorders. Postmortem, peripheral, cerebrospinal fluid and in vivo imaging studies provide evidence for the involvement of the endocannabinoid system in psychotic and mood disorders. Psychotic disorders and major depressive disorder exhibit alterations of brain cannabinoid CB1 receptors and peripheral blood endocannabinoids. Further, these changes may be sensitive to treatment status, disease state, and symptom severity. Evidence from psychotic disorder extend to endocannabinoid metabolizing enzymes in the brain and periphery, whereas these lines of evidence remain poorly developed in mood disorders. A paucity of studies examining this system in bipolar disorder represents a notable gap in the literature. Despite a growing body of productive work in this field of research, there is a clear need for investigation beyond the CB1 receptor in order to more fully elucidate the role of the endocannabinoid system in psychotic and mood disorders.},

	abstract = {Brief Summary
N-acyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (NAPEs) and their active metabolites, N-acyl-ethanolamides (NAEs) are lipid satiety factors that are normally biosynthesized in the intestinal tract in response to food intake. Reduced levels of NAPEs and NAEs have been found in obese individuals, and increasing plasma NAPE and NAEs levels may be beneficial to obese individuals trying to lose weight or to keep off weight gain after losing weight. We have found that oatmeal has large amounts of NAPEs, and based on previous mouse studies, we hypothesize that a single dose of dietary oatmeal is sufficient to double plasma NAE from baseline, possibly inducing satiety and increasing basal metabolic rate. To test this hypothesis, we will feed volunteers a single weight-based serving of oatmeal while monitoring its effects on serum glucose, NAPE and NAE levels as well as on subjective satiety.

Detailed Description
N-acyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (NAPEs) and their active metabolites, N-acyl-ethanolamides (NAEs) are lipid satiety factors that are normally biosynthesized in the intestinal tract in response to food intake. Reduced levels of NAPEs and NAEs have been found in obese individuals, so that increasing plasma NAPE and NAEs levels may be beneficial to obese individuals trying to lose weight or to keep off weight gain after losing weight. While NAPEs are endogenously synthesized by mammals in their intestinal tract, many other organisms, including plants, also biosynthesize NAPEs. Recent screening of a wide range of foods by our lab demonstrated that oatmeal (Regular Instant Oatmeal) had very large amounts of NAPEs (0.17 mg NAPE / g dry oatmeal), suggesting that consumption of oatmeal may be a straightforward mechanism for elevating plasma NAPE and NAE levels in obese individuals. Based on our previous mouse studies with synthetic NAPE and with bacteria biosynthesizing NAPE, we hypothesize that a dose of oatmeal sufficient to deliver 0.135 mg NAPE per kg body should be sufficient to double plasma NAE levels from baseline, thereby inducing satiety and increasing basal metabolic rate. For a 100 kg person, 80 grams of dry regular instant oatmeal (2 servings) provides this 0.135 mg / kg dose. (The dose of dry oatmeal per person = (body weight in kg / 100 kg){\textbackslash}* 80 g dry oatmeal. Thus for 50 kg person, 40 g dry oatmeal (1 serving) provides the required dose.) This amount of dry oatmeal is converted to the test meal by adding sufficient water to overtop oatmeal by about 1 cm (or to consistency desired by volunteer) and then microwaving for {\textbackslash}{\textasciitilde}3-4 minutes on high. In the initial testing, no additives such as butter, cream, or brown sugar should be used in preparation or serving oatmeal. Water can be consumed ad lib.},

The present pilot study assessed plasma concentrations of candidate endocannabinoids, sphingolipids and ceramides in individuals with adult ADHD in comparison with healthy controls and patients with affective disorders. Targeted lipid analyses of 23 different lipid species were performed in 71 mental disorder patients and 98 healthy controls (HC). The patients were diagnosed with adult ADHD (n = 12), affective disorder (major depression, MD n = 16 or bipolar disorder, BD n = 6) or adult ADHD with comorbid affective disorders (n = 37). Canonical discriminant analysis and CHAID analyses were used to identify major components that predicted the diagnostic group. ADHD patients had increased plasma concentrations of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P d18:1) and sphinganine-1-phosphate (S1P d18:0). In addition, the endocannabinoids, anandamide (AEA) and arachidonoylglycerol were increased. MD/BD patients had increased long chain ceramides, most prominently Cer22:0, but low endocannabinoids in contrast to ADHD patients. Patients with ADHD and comorbid affective disorders displayed increased S1P d18:1 and increased Cer22:0, but the individual lipid levels were lower than in the non-comorbid disorders. Sphingolipid profiles differ between patients suffering from ADHD and affective disorders, with overlapping patterns in comorbid patients. The S1P d18:1 to Cer22:0 ratio may constitute a diagnostic or prognostic tool.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Nutrients whose requirements should be adjusted in this way include calcium, magnesium, iron, zinc, protein, folate, vitamin A, and carotenoids. The diet-related factors that must be considered depend on the nature of the habitual diet and may include the chemical form of the nutrient and the nature of the dietary matrix, interactions between nutrients and/or organic components, and food preparation and processing practices within the country or region. The host-related factors can be further subdivided into intestinal and systemic factors. Reductions in the secretion of hydrochloric acid, gastric acid, and/or intrinsic factor, together with alterations in the permeability of the intestinal mucosa, are all examples of intestinal factors that can markedly influence the absorption of certain nutrients, but that are often ignored when setting dietary requirements. Systemic factors that should also be considered include nutrient status of the host, age, sex, ethnicity, genotype, and physiological state (e.g., pregnancy or lactation), and chronic and acute infectious disease states. Algorithms can estimate the bioavailability of iron, zinc, protein, folate, vitamin A, and carotenoids, although their accuracy is limited by the complex interactions among the absorption modifiers in the whole diet. For calcium and magnesium, the amount available for absorption is still estimated from their major food sources in the habitual diet. Currently, there are often large differences in the adjustments employed to convert physiological requirements to dietary requirements, even among countries consuming diets of similar patterns.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Substantial evidence implicates the nucleus accumbens in motivated performance, but very little is known about the neurochemical underpinnings of individual differences in motivation. Here, we applied 1 H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1 H-MRS) at ultra-high-field in the nucleus accumbens and inquired whether levels of glutamate (Glu), glutamine (Gln), GABA or their ratios predict interindividual differences in effort-based motivated task performance. Given the incentive value of social competition, we also examined differences in performance under self-motivated or competition settings. Our results indicate that higher accumbal Gln-to-Glu ratio predicts better overall performance and reduced effort perception. As performance is the outcome of multiple cognitive, motor and physiological processes, we applied computational modeling to estimate best-fitting individual parameters related to specific processes modeled with utility, effort and performance functions. This model-based analysis revealed that accumbal Gln-to-Glu ratio specifically relates to stamina; i.e., the capacity to maintain performance over long periods. It also indicated that competition boosts performance from task onset, particularly for low Gln-to-Glu individuals. In conclusion, our findings provide novel insights implicating accumbal Gln and Glu balance on the prediction of specific computational components of motivated performance. This approach and findings can help developing therapeutic strategies based on targeting metabolism to ameliorate deficits in effort engagement.},

	abstract = {The pharmacological modification of dopamine transmission has long been employed as a therapeutic tool in the treatment of many mental health disorders. However, as many of the pharmacotherapies today are not without significant side effects, or they alleviate only a particular subset of symptoms, the identification of novel therapeutic targets is imperative. In light of these challenges, the recognition that dopamine receptors can form heteromers has significantly expanded the range of physiologically relevant signaling complexes as well as potential drug targets. Furthermore, as the physiology and disease relevance of these receptor heteromers is further understood, their ability to exhibit pharmacological and functional properties distinct from their constituent receptors, or modulate the function of endogenous homomeric receptor complexes, may allow for the development of alternate therapeutic strategies and provide new avenues for drug design. In this review, we describe the emerging neurobiology of the known dopamine receptor heteromers, their physiological relevance in brain, and discuss the potential role of these receptor complexes in neuropsychiatric disease. We highlight their value as targets for future drug development and discuss innovative research strategies designed to selectively target these dopamine receptor heteromers in the search for novel and clinically efficacious pharmacotherapies.},

Behavioral and resting-state fMRI data were acquired before and after the intervention. Mindfulness meditation training, in comparison to health training, was found to significantly increase mindfulness while simultaneously reducing stress- and emotional-eating tendencies as well as food cravings. These behavioral results were accompanied by functional connectivity changes between the hypothalamus, reward regions, and several areas of the default mode network in addition to changes observed between the insula and somatosensory areas. Additional changes between seed regions (i.e., hypothalamus and insula) and brain areas attributed to emotion regulation, awareness, attention, and sensory integration were observed. Notably, these changes in functional connectivity correlated with behavioral changes, thereby providing insight into the underlying neural mechanisms of the effects of mindfulness on stress-eating.},

However, the brain is vulnerable to excessive oxidative insults resulting from neurometabolic processes, and whether antioxidant levels in the nucleus accumbens contribute to motivated performance is not known. Here, we identify a critical role for glutathione (GSH), the most important endogenous antioxidant in the brain, in motivation. Using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy at ultra-high field in both male humans and rodent populations, we establish that higher accumbal GSH levels are highly predictive of better, and particularly, steady performance over time in effort-related tasks. Causality was established in {\textless}italic{\textgreater}in vivo{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} experiments in rats that, first, showed that downregulating GSH levels through micro-injections of the GSH synthesis inhibitor buthionine sulfoximine in the nucleus accumbens impaired effort-based reward-incentivized performance. In addition, systemic treatment with the GSH precursor N-acetyl-cysteine increased accumbal GSH levels in rats and led to improved performance, potentially mediated by a cell-type-specific shift in glutamatergic inputs to accumbal medium spiny neurons. Our data indicate a close association between accumbal GSH levels and an individual’s capacity to exert reward-incentivized effort over time. They also suggest that improvement of accumbal antioxidant function may be a feasible approach to boost motivation. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Previous phosphorous magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( $^{\textrm{31}}$ P MRS) studies demonstrate cerebral ATP declines with age. The purpose of this study was to explore the functional relationships of frontal and posterior ATP levels with cognition in healthy aging. Here, we measured frontal and posterior ATP levels using $^{\textrm{31}}$ P MRS at 3 Tesla (3 T) and assessed cognition using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in 30 healthy older adults. We found that greater frontal, but not posterior, ATP levels were significantly associated with better MoCA performance.

The aim of this review is to describe the properties of nutrigenomic activators of transcription factor Nrf2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2‐related factor 2), comparing the potential for sulforaphane and other phytochemicals to demonstrate clinical efficacy as complementary medicines. Broccoli‐derived sulforaphane emerges as a phytochemical with this capability, with oral doses capable of favourably modifying genes associated with chemoprevention. Compared with widely used phytochemical‐based supplements like curcumin, silymarin, and resveratrol, sulforaphane more potently activates Nrf2 to induce the expression of a battery of cytoprotective genes. By virtue of its lipophilic nature and low molecular weight, sulforaphane displays significantly higher bioavailability than the polyphenol‐based dietary supplements that also activate Nrf2. Nrf2 activation induces cytoprotective genes such as those playing key roles in cellular defense mechanisms including redox status and detoxification. Both its high bioavailability and significant Nrf2 inducer capacity contribute to the therapeutic potential of sulforaphane‐yielding supplements.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

However, mushrooms are overlooked as a vitamin D source in dietary guidelines. Our dietary modelling shows that four serves/week of UV-exposed button mushrooms can support most Australian adults in meeting vitamin D recommendations, and UV-exposed mushrooms have been found to increase vitamin D status in deficient individuals. While recent evidence suggests some differences between vitamin D $_{\textrm{2}}$ and vitamin D $_{\textrm{3}}$ in physiological activities, vitamin D $_{\textrm{2}}$ from mushrooms can be part of a larger solution to increasing dietary vitamin D intakes, as well as an important focus for public health policy.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Vitamin K2, a natural fat-soluble vitamin, is a potent neuroprotective molecule, owing to its antioxidant effect, but its mechanism has not been fully elucidated. Therefore, we stimulated SH-SY5Y cells with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) in a proper dose-dependent manner, followed by a treatment of vitamin K2. In the presence of 6-OHDA, cell viability was reduced, the mitochondrial membrane potential was decreased, and the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was increased. Moreover, the treatment of 6-OHDA promoted mitochondria-mediated apoptosis and abnormal mitochondrial fission and fusion. However, vitamin K2 significantly suppressed 6-OHDA-induced changes. Vitamin K2 played a significant part in apoptosis by upregulating and downregulating Bcl-2 and Bax protein expressions, respectively, which inhibited mitochondrial depolarization, and ROS accumulation to maintain mitochondrial structure and functional stabilities. Additionally, vitamin K2 significantly inhibited the 6-OHDA-induced downregulation of the MFN1/2 level and upregulation of the DRP1 level, respectively, and this enabled cells to maintain the dynamic balance of mitochondrial fusion and fission. Furthermore, vitamin K2 treatments downregulated the expression level of p62 and upregulated the expression level of LC3A in 6-OHDA-treated cells via the PINK1/Parkin signaling pathway, thereby promoting mitophagy. Moreover, it induced mitochondrial biogenesis in 6-OHDA damaged cells by promoting the expression of PGC-1α, NRF1, and TFAM. These indicated that vitamin K2 can release mitochondrial damage, and that this effect is related to the participation of vitamin K2 in the regulation of the mitochondrial quality-control loop, through the maintenance of the mitochondrial quality-control system, and repair mitochondrial dysfunction, thereby alleviating neuronal cell death mediated by mitochondrial damage.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Their collective effects are particularly prevalent to numerous aspects of brain function, including energy production, DNA/RNA synthesis/repair, genomic and non-genomic methylation, and the synthesis of numerous neurochemicals and signaling molecules. However, human epidemiological and controlled trial investigations, and the resultant scientific commentary, have focused almost exclusively on the small sub-set of vitamins (B9/B12/B6) that are the most prominent (but not the exclusive) B-vitamins involved in homocysteine metabolism. Scant regard has been paid to the other B vitamins. This review describes the closely inter-related functions of the eight B-vitamins and marshals evidence suggesting that adequate levels of all members of this group of micronutrients are essential for optimal physiological and neurological functioning. Furthermore, evidence from human research clearly shows both that a significant proportion of the populations of developed countries suffer from deficiencies or insufficiencies in one or more of this group of vitamins, and that, in the absence of an optimal diet, administration of the entire B-vitamin group, rather than a small sub-set, at doses greatly in excess of the current governmental recommendations, would be a rational approach for preserving brain health.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Therefore, understanding the pharmacokinetics of vitamins provides critical insights into absorption, distribution, and metabolism, all of which are essential for achieving the desired pharmacological response. In this review paper, we present information on vitamin deficiencies and emphasize the significance of understanding vitamin pharmacokinetics for improved clinical research. The pharmacokinetics of several vitamins face various challenges, and thus, this work briefly outlines the current issues and their potential solutions. We also discuss the feasibility of enhanced nanocarrier‐based pharmaceutical formulations for delivering vitamins. Recent studies have shown a preference for nanoformulations, which can address major limitations such as stability, solubility, absorption, and toxicity. Ultimately, the pharmacokinetics of pharmaceutical dosage forms containing vitamins can impede the treatment of diseases and disorders related to vitamin deficiency.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In the present study, we evaluated the impact of the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism on individual differences in personality traits in a sample of healthy volunteers in relation to other common gene variants thought to be involved in the pathophysiology of affective disorders, such as the serotonin transporter promoter polymorphism (5-HTTLPR) and a variable number of tandem repeat polymorphism of the dopamine transporter gene (DAT VNTR). Personality traits were assessed using the NEO personality inventory (NEO-PI-R) and Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire (TPQ). There was a significant DAT VNTR-dependent association between NEO-PI-R Neuroticism and the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism. Among individuals with at least one copy of the DAT 9-repeat allele, carriers of the BDNF Met allele exhibited significantly lower Neuroticism scores than noncarriers. This interaction was also observed for TPQ Harm Avoidance, a personality dimension related to Neuroticism.

Nutritional adequacy is the comparison between the nutrient requirement and the intake of a certain individual or population. In population groups, the prevalence of nutrient inadequacy can be assessed by the probability approach or using the Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) cut-point method. However, dietary patterns can also be used as they have moderate to good validity to assess adequate intakes of some nutrients. The objective of this study was to review the available evidence on the Nutritional Adequacy of the Mediterranean Diet. The inclusion of foods typical of the Mediterranean diet and greater adherence to this healthy pattern was related to a better nutrient profile, both in children and adults, with a lower prevalence of individuals showing inadequate intakes of micronutrients.

Therefore, we aimed to investigate the association between carbohydrate intake and metabolic syndrome in Korean women. A cross-sectional analysis was conducted with a total of 4294 Korean women aged 40–69 years from the Korean Genomic and Epidemiology Study (KoGES). Carbohydrate intake was calculated based on a validated food frequency questionnaire. Metabolic syndrome was defined by using the National Cholesterol Education Program, Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEPIII). Logistic regression was used to estimate the association of carbohydrate intake with metabolic syndrome and its components. In this study, high carbohydrate intake seemed to be associated with low socioeconomic status and an imbalanced diet. After adjusting for confounding factors, subjects with higher carbohydrate intake showed an increased risk of metabolic syndrome (odds ratio (OR) 1.34, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.08–1.66, p-trend = 0.004, highest vs. lowest quartile [≥75.2 vs. \&lt;67.0\% of energy]), particularly elevated waist circumference. This association was stronger among those with low levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and those with low dairy intake. In conclusion, higher carbohydrate intake is associated with a higher risk of metabolic syndrome, particularly abdominal obesity, in Korean women. This association may differ according to individuals’ CRP level and dairy intake.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Tight regulation of glucose metabolism in response to stimuli is essential for brain physiology. Glucose metabolism and cerebral blood flow are closely coordinated during neuronal activity to maintain proper brain function. In a previous article, we have already detailed the mechanisms by which the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is involved in the efficiency of glucose uptake by stimulating GLUT-1 action and NO-mediated vasodilation. In this article, we now clarify how the activation of BDNF helps to stimulate the IRS-1/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and upregulates NMDA receptor activity.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} A large body of data gathered over the past couple of years has identified the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) α, γ, and β/δ as transcription factors exerting modulatory actions in vascular cells. PPARs, which belong to the nuclear receptor family of ligand-activated transcription factors, were originally described as gene regulators of various metabolic pathways. Although the PPARα, γ, and β/δ subtypes are ≈60\% to 80\% homologous in their ligand- and DNA-binding domains, significant differences in ligand and target gene specificities are observed. PPARα is activated by polyunsaturated fatty acids and oxidized derivatives and by lipid-modifying drugs of the fibrate family, including fenofibrate or gemfibrozil. PPARα controls expression of genes implicated in lipid metabolism. PPARγ, in contrast, is a key regulator of glucose homeostasis and adipogenesis. Ligands of PPARγ include naturally occurring FA derivatives, such as hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids (HODEs), prostaglandin derivatives such as 15-deoxyΔ $^{\textrm{12,14}}$ -prostaglandin J $_{\textrm{2}}$ , and glitazones, insulin-sensitizing drugs presently used to treat patients with type 2 diabetes. Ligands for PPARβ/δ are polyunsaturated fatty acids, prostaglandins, and synthetic compounds, some of which are presently in clinical development. PPARβ/δ stimulates fatty acid oxidation predominantly acting in muscle. All PPARs are expressed in vascular cells, where they exhibit antiinflammatory and antiatherogenic properties. In addition, studies in various animal models as well as clinical data suggest that PPARα and PPARγ activators can modulate atherogenesis in vivo. At present, no data are available relating to possible effects of PPARβ/δ agonists on atherogenesis. Given the widespread use of PPARα and PPARγ agonists in patients at high risk for cardiovascular disease, the understanding of their function in the vasculature is not only of basic interest but also has important clinical implications. This review will focus on the role of PPARs in the vasculature and summarize the present understanding of their effects on atherogenesis and its cardiovascular complications. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Magnesium (Mg) is involved in essential cellular and physiological processes. Globally, inadequate consumption of Mg is widespread among populations, especially those who consume processed foods, and its homeostasis is impaired in obese individuals and type 2 diabetes patients. Since Mg deficiency triggers oxidative stress and chronic inflammation, common features of several frequent chronic non-communicable diseases, interest in this mineral is growing in clinical medicine as well as in biomedicine. To date, very little is known about the role of Mg deficiency in adipose tissue. In obesity, the increase in fat tissue leads to changes in the release of cytokines, causing low-grade inflammation and macrophage infiltration. Hypomagnesemia in obesity can potentiate the excessive production of reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial dysfunction, and decreased ATP production. Importantly, Mg plays a role in regulating intracellular calcium concentration and is involved in carbohydrate metabolism and insulin receptor activity. This narrative review aims to consolidate existing knowledge, identify research gaps, and raise awareness of the critical role of Mg in supporting adipose tissue metabolism and preventing oxidative stress.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by inattention, impulsivity and/or hyperactivity. In recent years, metabolic alterations, primarily obesity, insulin resistance, and diabetes, have emerged as frequent comorbidities in individuals with ADHD, suggesting a bidirectional relationship between neurodevelopmental and metabolic dysfunctions. Emerging evidence indicates that dysregulation of dopaminergic signaling, disturbances in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and chronic low-grade inflammation are central to both ADHD symptomatology and metabolic impairments. For instance, alterations in dopamine-related genes (e.g., DRD4, DAT1) not only affect cognitive and behavioral functions but also play a role in appetite regulation and glucose homeostasis. Epidemiological studies further demonstrate that individuals with ADHD exhibit poorer glycemic control and a higher prevalence of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, while early-life metabolic challenges such as maternal diabetes may predispose offspring to ADHD. This review aims to comprehensively synthesize the epidemiological, genetic, and pathogenetic evidence linking ADHD to metabolic alterations. We discuss key pathophysiological pathways—including dopaminergic dysregulation, HPA axis disturbances, inflammation, and oxidative stress—and evaluate their contributions to the co-occurrence of ADHD and metabolic disorders. In addition, we explore the clinical implications and integrated treatment approaches that encompass lifestyle modifications, pharmacological therapies, and multidisciplinary care. Finally, we outline future research directions to develop personalized and holistic interventions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}A growing body of literature suggests that physical activity beneficially influences brain function during adulthood, particularly frontal lobe-mediated cognitive processes, such as planning, scheduling, inhibition, and working memory. For our hunter-gatherer ancestors, times of famine interspersed with times of feast necessitated bouts of intense physical activity balanced by periods of rest. However, the sedentary lifestyle that pervades modern society has overridden the necessity for a physically active lifestyle. The impact of inactivity on disease processes has been the focus of much attention; the growing understanding that physical activity also has the benefit of enhancing cognitive performance strengthens the imperative for interventions that are successful in increasing physical activity, with the outcomes of promoting health and productivity. Population health and performance programs that promote physical activity provide benefits for employees and employers through improvements in worker health and performance and financial returns for the company. In this review, we examine the mechanisms by which physical activity improves cognition. We also review studies that evaluate the effects of physical activity on cognitive executive performance in adulthood, including longitudinal studies that address the impact of physical activity during early adulthood and midlife on preservation of cognition later in life. This is of particular importance given that adulthood represents prime working years and that physical activity promotion is a key component of population health and performance programs. Finally, we provide recommendations for maximizing the lasting benefits of movement and physical activity on cognition in adulthood.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Study quality was assessed by using the Newcastle‐Ottawa Scale, and random‐effects model meta‐analyses were performed. A total of 18,391,169 (ADHD: {\textless}italic{\textgreater}n{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}  = 421,224) individuals from 11 studies were included in our systematic review and 8,196,648 (ADHD = 332,619) individuals from five studies were included in the main meta‐analysis of adjusted estimates. Pooled estimates showed that ADHD was significantly associated with an increased risk of CVDs in analyses based on adjusted effect size (odds ratio (OR) = 1.96; 95\% confidence interval (CI) = 1.19–2.23, {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Q{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}  = 140.74, {\textless}italic{\textgreater}P{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} $_{\textrm{Q}}$  \&lt; 0.001, {\textless}italic{\textgreater}I{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} $^{\textrm{2}}$  = 97.2\%).

In subgroup analyses, we found increased risk of CVDs associated with ADHD across age groups, type of CVDs, and data sources. This systematic review and meta‐analyses indicate that ADHD is associated with increased risk for CVDs, but further studies with various study designs are warranted to advance the understanding of the underlying mechanisms for the observed association between ADHD and CVDs.

The most evident factors of age-related muscle alterations comprise impairment in protein turnover rate, neurodegenerative processes, reduction in anabolic hormone production and action, dysregulation of cytokine secretions, changes in the response to inflammatory events, sedentary lifestyle and inadequate nutritional intakes. Indeed, nutrition, in particular low protein intakes, may participate in the loss of protein mass during aging. Consequently, numerous studies have focused on the possibility to counteract the age effect on muscle loss by changing the quantity but also the quality of ingested proteins, aiming to optimize protein intake and retention through an improvement in amino acid bioavailability for the muscle tissues.

Recent findings 

It has long been recognized that numerous dietary parameters, such as the amount of dietary proteins, affect protein metabolism. Recently, new concepts have been developed by testing either different types of protein sources, proteins with various digestion rates, meals with pulse or spread protein-feeding patterns or amino acids with specific anabolic function. This is therefore a new area in which not only quantitative but also qualitative properties of dietary protein are considered as a strategy to limit body protein loss during aging.

Summary 

Recent studies have reported sarcopenia to be preventable by using nutritional intervention, but more experimental and clinical evidence is needed to modify the current recommendation in daily protein intake. The new concepts currently developed must be validated using large epidemiological studies in the long term before being applied to the elderly population.},

Common anabolic stimuli/signals in skeletal muscle are hormones (insulin, growth hormones, IGF-1, androgens, and β-agonists such epinephrine), substrates (amino acids such as protein precursors on top, but also glucose and fat, as source of energy), metabolites (such as β-agonists and HMB), various biochemical/intracellular mediators), physical exercise, neurogenic and immune-modulating factors, etc. Each of them may exhibit a reduced effect upon skeletal muscle in ageing. In this article, we overview the role of anabolic signals on muscle metabolism, as well as currently available evidence of resistance, at the skeletal muscle level, to anabolic factors, from both in vitro and in vivo studies.

Non-vegetarian diets were compared to vegetarian dietary patterns (i.e., vegan and lacto-ovo-vegetarian) on selected health outcomes. Vegetarian diets confer protection against cardiovascular diseases, cardiometabolic risk factors, some cancers and total mortality. Compared to lacto-ovo-vegetarian diets, vegan diets seem to offer additional protection for obesity, hypertension, type-2 diabetes, and cardiovascular mortality.

The purpose of this review is to summarize the current knowledge on the positive and negative aspects of a vegan diet regarding the risk of AD. Regarding AD prevention, a vegan diet includes low levels of saturated fats and cholesterol, contributing to a healthy blood lipid profile. Furthermore, it is rich in phytonutrients, such as vitamins, antioxidants, and dietary fiber, that may help prevent cognitive decline. Moreover, a vegan diet contributes to the assumption of quercetin, a natural inhibitor of monoamine oxidase (MAO), which can contribute to maintaining mental health and reducing AD risk. Nonetheless, the data available do not allow an assessment of whether strict veganism is beneficial for AD prevention compared with vegetarianism or other diets. A vegan diet lacks specific vitamins and micronutrients and may result in nutritional deficiencies. Vegans not supplementing micronutrients are more prone to vitamin B12, vitamin D, and DHA deficiencies, which have been linked to AD. Thus, an evaluation of the net effect of a vegan diet on AD prevention and/or progression should be ascertained by taking into account all the positive and negative effects described here.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Accumulating evidence suggests a higher risk for cardiovascular diseases among individuals with mental disorders, but very little is known about the risk for overall and specific groups of cardiovascular diseases in people with attention‐deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). To fill this knowledge gap, we investigated the prospective associations between ADHD and a wide range of cardiovascular diseases in adults. In a nationwide population‐based cohort study, we identified 5,389,519 adults born between 1941 and 1983, without pre‐existing cardiovascular diseases, from Swedish registers. The study period was from January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2013. Incident cardiovascular disease events were identified according to ICD codes. Hazard ratios (HR) with 95\% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using Cox proportional hazards regression model, with ADHD as a time‐varying exposure. After an average 11.80 years of follow‐up, 38.05\% of individuals with ADHD versus 23.57\% of those without ADHD had at least one diagnosis of cardiovascular disease (p\&lt;0.0001). ADHD was significantly associated with increased risk of any cardiovascular disease (HR=2.05, 95\% CI: 1.98‐2.13) after adjusting for sex and year of birth. Further adjustments for education level, birth country, type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, dyslipidemia, sleep problems and heavy smoking attenuated the association, which however remained significant (HR=1.84, 95\% CI: 1.77‐1.91). Further adjustment for psychiatric comorbidities attenuated but could not fully explain the association (HR=1.65, 95\% CI: 1.59‐1.71). The strongest associations were found for cardiac arrest (HR=2.28, 95\% CI: 1.81‐2.87), hemorrhagic stroke (HR=2.16, 95\% CI: 1.68‐2.77), and peripheral vascular disease/arteriosclerosis (HR=2.05, 95\% CI: 1.76‐2.38). Stronger associations were observed in males and younger adults, while comparable associations were found among individuals with or without psychotropic medications and family history of cardiovascular diseases. These data suggest that ADHD is an independent risk factor for a wide range of cardiovascular diseases. They highlight the importance of carefully monitoring cardiovascular health and developing age‐appropriate and individualized strategies to reduce the cardiovascular risk in individuals with ADHD.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Dan and his team of demographers, scientist and anthropologists were able to distill the evidence-based common denominators of these Blue Zones into 9 commonalities that they call the Power 9. They have since taken these principles into communities across the United States working with policy makers, local businesses, schools and individuals to shape the environments of the Blue Zones Project Communities. What has been found is that putting the responsibility of curating a healthy environment on an individual does not work, but through policy and environmental changes the Blue Zones Project Communities have been able to increase life expectancy, reduce obesity and make the healthy choice the easy choice for millions of Americans.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

This will lead us to propose a new classification of food products based on processing for future epidemiological studies. As a result of applying the holistic approach, health food potential will be redefined based on both food structure and nutrient density.

It later turned out that eCB was more intricate than previously thought. It has a pervasive role and exerts a multitude of cellular signaling mechanisms, regulating various physiological neurotransmission pathways in the human brain, including the dopaminergic (DA) system. eCB roles toward DA system were robust, clearly delineated, and reproducible with respect to physiological as well as pathological neurochemical and neurobehavioral manifestations of DA system, particularly those involving the nigrostriatal and mesocorticolimbic pathways. The eCB–DA system regulates the basics in the Maslow’s pyramid of hierarchy of needs required for individual survival such as food and sexual activity for reproductive purpose to those of higher needs in the pyramid, including self-actualization behaviors leading to achievement and reward (e.g., academic- and/or work-related performance and achievements). It is, thus, interesting to specifically discuss the eCB–DA system, not only on the molecular level, but also its tremendous potential to be developed as a future therapeutic strategy for various neuropsychiatric problems, including obesity, drug addiction and withdrawal, pathological hypersexuality, or low motivation behaviors.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

However, their digestibility varies due to factors such as molecular structure, amino acid composition, and processing methods. This review comprehensively analyzes methods used to assess plant protein digestibility, including in vivo, in vitro, and ex vivo approaches. While in vivo studies, particularly those using pigs, are considered the gold standard, in vitro and ex vivo models offer cost-effective and reproducible alternatives for simulating digestion. Additionally, antinutritional factors present in plant proteins can hinder digestibility, necessitating processing strategies such as fermentation, enzymatic hydrolysis, and high-pressure treatments to enhance protein bioavailability. Advances in evaluation techniques, including the Digestible Indispensable Amino Acid Score (DIAAS) and dynamic digestion models, offer more precise assessments of protein quality. By systematically comparing these methods, this review aims to guide food scientists and manufacturers in selecting appropriate evaluation strategies to improve the nutritional quality of plant-based protein products. Understanding the mechanisms influencing plant protein digestibility is essential for optimizing food formulations and supporting the broader adoption of sustainable protein sources in human diets.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Neurological disorders include a variety of conditions, including Alzheimer’s disease, motor neuron disease and Parkinson’s disease, affecting longevity and quality of life, and their pathogenesis is associated with oxidative stress. Several of the chronic neurodegenerative pathologies of the CNS share some common features, such as oxidative stress, inflammation, synapse dysfunctions, protein misfolding and defective autophagia. Neuroinflammation can involve the activation of mast cells, contributing to oxidative stress, in addition to other sources of reactive oxygen species. Antioxidants can powerfully neutralize reactive oxygen species and free radicals, decreasing oxidative damage. Antioxidant genes, like the manganese superoxide dismutase enzyme, can undergo epigenetic changes that reduce their expression, thus increasing oxidative stress in tissue. Alternatively, DNA can be altered by free radical damage. The epigenetic landscape of these genes can change antioxidant function and may result in neurodegenerative disease. This imbalance of free radical production and antioxidant function increases the reactive oxygen species that cause cell damage in neurons and is often observed as an age-related event. Increased antioxidant expression in mice is protective against reactive oxygen species in neurons as is the exogenous supplementation of antioxidants. Manganese superoxide dismutase requires manganese for its enzymic function. Antioxidant therapy is considered for age-related neurodegenerative diseases, and a new mimetic of a manganese superoxide dismutase, avasopasem manganese, is described and suggested as a putative treatment to reduce the oxidative stress that causes neurodegenerative disease. The aim of this narrative review is to explore the evidence that oxidative stress causes neurodegenerative damage and the role of antioxidant genes in inhibiting reactive oxygen species damage. Can the neuronal environment of oxidative stress, causing neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, be reduced or reversed?{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We conducted a metaanalysis to analyze the serum Mn levels in patients with AD and MCI. A systematic database search of PubMed, Web of Science, and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) identified 17 studies, including 836 cases and 1254 health controls (HC). Random‐effects meta‐analysis showed that patients with AD had significantly reduced serum Mn levels compared with HC subjects (SMD = −0.39; 95\% CI (−0.71, −0.08); p = 0.015). MCI individuals had a tendency toward reduced serum Mn levels compared with HC subjects (SMD = −0.31; 95\% CI (−0.70, 0.08); p = 0.117). A significant decrease in serum Mn levels was found in patients with cognitive impairment (including both AD patients and MCI patients) (SMD = −0.37, 95\% CI (−0.60; −0.13); p = 0.002). Finally, no significant differences were observed between AD and MCI patients in serum levels (SMD = 0.24; 95\% CI (−0.23, 0.72); p = 0.310). Our findings show that the serum Mn levels are lower in AD patients, and Mn deficiency may be a risk factor for AD.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Vitamin E does not work in isolation from other antioxidants, but rather is part of an interlinking set of antioxidant cycles, which has been termed the “antioxidant network”. This antioxidant network is highlighted in the regulation of nuclear transcription. The linkage of vitamin E to other antioxidant substances, and their ability to regenerate vitamin E, means that other antioxidants (especially redox active thiols) may influence nuclear transcription not only directly through their own antioxidant effects, but indirectly by regenerating vitamin E as well. Hence, antioxidants are interlinked in a network that influences cell functions previously thought to be remote from antioxidant effects. The implications of such effects are just beginning to be understood.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The gastrointestinal tract harbors a densely populated community of microbes that exhibits sexual dimorphism. Dysbiosis of this community has been associated with chronic human disease states ranging from metabolic diseases to neuropsychiatric disorders (NPDs). The gut microbiota–gut–brain axis (GMGBA) is a bi-directional pathway that facilitates the interaction of the gut microflora with host physiological functions. Recently, research surrounding the potential roles of the GMGBA in the development of NPDs (e.g., depression, anxiety, and autism spectrum disorders (ASDs)) has increased. However, the role of the GMGBA in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), an NPD that affects an estimated 8.4\% of children (5.1\% of female and 11.5\% of male children) and 4\% of adults (with a male–female odds ratio of 1.6) in the United States, remains understudied. Herein, we synthesize the current literature regarding the GMGBA, ADHD, and the potentially relevant intersections between the GMGBA and ADHD. Recommendations are presented for pathways of future research into the role(s) of the GMGBA in ADHD etiology and symptomatology. Particular focus is given to the potential for the variable of host sex to act as an outcome modifier of the relationship between the GMGBA and ADHD.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We examined whether a combination of CoQ $_{\textrm{10}}$ with creatine can exert additive neuroprotective effects in a MPTP mouse model of Parkinson’s disease, a 3‐NP rat model of Huntington’s disease (HD) and the R6/2 transgenic mouse model of HD. The combination of the two agents produced additive neuroprotective effects against dopamine depletion in the striatum and loss of tyrosine hydroxylase neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) following chronic subcutaneous administration of MPTP. The combination treatment resulted in significant reduction in lipid peroxidation and pathologic α‐synuclein accumulation in the SNpc neurons of the MPTP‐treated mice. We also observed additive neuroprotective effects in reducing striatal lesion volumes produced by chronic subcutaneous administration of 3‐NP to rats. The combination treatment showed significant effects on blocking 3‐NP‐induced impairment of glutathione homeostasis and reducing lipid peroxidation and DNA oxidative damage in the striatum. Lastly, the combination of CoQ $_{\textrm{10}}$ and creatine produced additive neuroprotective effects on improving motor performance and extending survival in the transgenic R6/2 HD mice. These findings suggest that combination therapy using CoQ $_{\textrm{10}}$ and creatine may be useful in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease and HD. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The literature review included publications available in ISI Web of Science and Google Scholar published between 2014 and 2024. Findings indicate that edible offal is characterized by a nutrient concentration often surpassing that found in skeletal muscle. This review discusses the yield of edible offal and explores factors influencing human consumption. Selected factors affecting the nutritional value of offal of various animals and the importance of individual nutrients in ensuring the proper functioning of the human body were analyzed. The optimal use of offal in processing and catering can significantly benefit aspects of human life, including diet quality, food security, and conservation of natural resources.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

This review synthesizes mechanistic insights demonstrating how live starter cultures and their fermentation-derived metabolites (short-chain fatty acids, bioactive peptides, and exopolysaccharides) act synergistically to enhance microbial diversity, reinforce epithelial barrier integrity via upregulation of tight-junction proteins, and modulate immune signaling. Clinical evidence supports significant improvements in metabolic parameters (fasting glucose, lipid profiles, blood pressure) and reductions in systemic inflammation across metabolic syndrome, hypertension, and IBS cohorts. We highlight critical modulatory factors—including strain specificity, host enterotypes and FUT2 genotype, fermentation parameters, and matrix composition—that govern probiotic engraftment, postbiotic yield, and therapeutic efficacy. Despite promising short-term outcomes, current studies are limited by heterogeneous designs and brief intervention periods, underscoring the need for long-term, adaptive trials and integrative multi-omics to establish durability and causality. Looking forward, precision nutrition frameworks that harness baseline microbiota profiling, host genetics, and data-driven fermentation design will enable bespoke fermented dairy formulations, transforming these traditional foods into next-generation functional matrices for targeted prevention and management of metabolic, inflammatory, and neuroimmune disorders.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

This review aims to synthesize scientific publications on the potential of offal as a source of nutrients and bioactive substances in human diets. The literature review included publications available in ISI Web of Science and Google Scholar published between 2014 and 2024. Findings indicate that edible offal is characterized by a nutrient concentration often surpassing that found in skeletal muscle. This review discusses the yield of edible offal and explores factors influencing human consumption. Selected factors affecting the nutritional value of offal of various animals and the importance of individual nutrients in ensuring the proper functioning of the human body were analyzed. The optimal use of offal in processing and catering can significantly benefit aspects of human life, including diet quality, food security, and conservation of natural resources.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND
            Unhealthy maternal diet leads to heavy metal exposures from the consumption of ultra-processed foods that may impact gene behavior across generations, creating conditions for the neurodevelopmental disorders known as autism and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Children with these disorders have difficulty metabolizing and excreting heavy metals from their bloodstream, and the severity of their symptoms correlates with the heavy metal levels measured in their blood. Psychiatrists may play a key role in helping parents reduce their ultra-processed food and dietary heavy metal intake by providing access to effective nutritional epigenetics education.
            AIM
            To test the efficacy of nutritional epigenetics instruction in reducing parental ultra-processed food intake.
            METHODS
            The study utilized a semi-randomized test and control group pretest-posttest pilot study design with participants recruited from parents having a learning-disabled child with autism or ADHD. Twenty-two parents who met the inclusion criteria were randomly selected to serve in the test (n  = 11) or control (n  = 11) group. The test group participated in the six-week online nutritional epigenetics tutorial, while the control group did not. The efficacy of the nutritional epigenetics instruction was determined by measuring changes in parent diet and attitude using data derived from an online diet survey administered to the participants during the pre and post intervention periods. Diet intake scores were derived for both ultra-processed and whole/organic foods. Paired sample t -tests were conducted to determine any differences in mean diet scores within each group.
            RESULTS
            There was a significant difference in the diet scores of the test group between the pre- and post-intervention periods. The parents in the test group significantly reduced their intake of ultra-processed foods with a pre-intervention diet score of 70 (mean = 5.385, SD = 2.534) and a post-intervention diet score of 113 (mean = 8.692, SD = 1.750) and the paired t -test analysis showing a significance of P  {\textless} 0.001. The test group also significantly increased their consumption of whole and/or organic foods with a pre-intervention diet score of 100 (mean = 5.882, SD = 2.472) and post-intervention diet score of 121 (mean = 7.118, SD = 2.390) and the paired t -test analysis showing a significance of P  {\textless} 0.05.
            CONCLUSION
            Here we show nutritional epigenetics education can be used to reduce ultra-processed food intake and improve attitude among parents having learning-disabled children with autism or ADHD.},

	abstract = {Introduction
              Contamination of cocoa containing products, such as dark chocolate, with heavy metals including lead, cadmium and arsenic has been reported in the US. However, a formal exploration into the significance of this contamination, nor multi-year trends in the degree or scope remain unresolved.
            
            
              Methods
              From 2014 to 2022, 72 consumer cocoa-containing products were purchased and analyzed for heavy metal contamination with lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), and arsenic (As) in 4 distinct cohorts (2014, 2016, 2019, 2022). The thresholds used to assess heavy metal contamination were set to Prop 65 maximum allowable dose levels (MADLs) of 0.5 mcg/day, 4.1 mcg/day, 10 mcg/day for Pb, Cd, and As, respectively.
            
            
              Results and discussion
              Our analysis reports that 43, 35, and 0\% of the products tested exceed Prop 65 MADLs for heavy metal concentrations, respectively, of Pb, Cd, and As, while 97.2\% (70 of 72) fall below US FDA IRL limits established for Pb. Median concentrations of each metal tested were lower than even the conservative Prop 65 MADLs, indicating a potentially large effect of product outliers. This indicates that heavy metal contamination—in more than half of products tested—may not pose any appreciable risk for the average person when consumed as a single serving; however, consuming some of the products tested, or more than one serving per day in combination with non-cocoa derived sources heavy metals, may add up to exposure that would exceed the Prop 65 MADLs. Notably, “organic” products were significantly more likely to demonstrate higher levels of both Cd and Pb.},

            Nutritional intervention plays a significant role in controlling the progression of chronic diseases and improving therapeutic outcomes. Food functional factors are bioactive compounds found in foods that can regulate body's physiological functions and support health by regulating enzyme activity and metabolic pathways. However, many food functional factors face significant challenges in terms of their bioavailability, stability, and solubility. Furthermore, individual differences in genetics, metabolism, lifestyle, and environmental factors can significantly influence nutrient requirements and intake. Therefore, personalized nutritional intervention and precise delivery based on individual characteristics are necessary to achieve precision nutrition. Steady‐state targeted delivery systems have emerged as a promising approach to improving the precise nutritional interventions for chronic diseases. In this review, we explore the latest progress in the steady‐state targeted delivery of food functional components for precision nutrition. We discuss the challenges and opportunities associated with these systems as well as their potential applications in managing chronic diseases and improving health outcomes. The review highlights the significant role that steady‐state targeted delivery systems can play in advancing precision nutrition and thus promoting better health for individuals.},

              Introduction
              We examined the extent to which attention‐deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a neurodevelopmental disorder, is linked with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and any dementia, neurodegenerative diseases, across generations.
            
            
              Methods
              A nationwide cohort born between 1980 and 2001 (index persons) were linked to their biological relatives (parents, grandparents, uncles/aunts) using Swedish national registers. We used Cox models to examine the cross‐generation associations.
            
            
              Results
              Among relatives of 2,132,929 index persons, 3042 parents, 171,732 grandparents, and 1369 uncles/aunts had a diagnosis of AD. Parents of individuals with ADHD had an increased risk of AD (hazard ratio 1.55, 95\% confidence interval 1.26–1.89). The associations attenuated but remained elevated in grandparents and uncles/aunts. The association for early‐onset AD was stronger than late‐onset AD. Similar results were observed for any dementia.
            
            
              Discussion
              ADHD is associated with AD and any dementia across generations. The associations attenuated with decreasing genetic relatedness, suggesting shared familial risk between ADHD and AD.},

              Detail recent advancements in the science on ultra-processed food (UPF) addiction, focusing on estimated prevalence rates and emerging health disparities; progress towards identifying biological underpinnings and behavioral mechanisms; and implications for weight management.
            
            
              Recent Findings
              Notable developments in the field have included: (1) estimating the global prevalence of UPF addiction at 14\% of adults and 15\% of youths; (2) revealing health disparities for persons of color and those with food insecurity; (3) observing altered functioning across the brain-gut-microbiome axis; (4) providing early evidence for UPF withdrawal; and (5) elucidating poorer weight management outcomes among persons with UPF addiction.
            
            
              Summary
              The breadth of recent work on UPF addiction illustrates continued scientific and public interest in the construct and its implications for understanding and treating overeating behaviors and obesity. One pressing gap is the lack of targeted interventions for UPF addiction, which may result in more optimal clinical outcomes for this underserved population.},

              The aim of this study was to investigate the possible interaction of mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammatory cytokines in the risk of anxiety and depression. We utilized the UK Biobank for the sample of this study. A mitochondria-wide association(MiWAS) and interaction analysis was performed to investigate the interaction effects of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)×C-reactive protein (CRP) on the risks of self-reported anxiety (
              N
               = 72,476), general anxiety disorder (GAD-7) scores (
              N
               = 80,853), self-reported depression (
              N
               = 80,778), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) scores (
              N
               = 80,520) in total samples, females and males, respectively, adjusting for sex, age, Townsend deprivation index (TDI), education score, alcohol intake, smoking and 10 principal components. In all, 25 mtSNPs and 10 mtSNPs showed significant level of association with self-reported anxiety and GAD-7 score respectively. A total of seven significant mtDNA × CRP interactions were found for anxiety, such as m.3915G{\textgreater}A(
              MT-ND1
              ) for self-reported anxiety in total subjects (
              P
               = 6.59 × 10
              −3
              ), m.4561T{\textgreater}C(
              MT-ND2
              ) (
              P
               = 3.04 × 10
              −3
              ) for GAD-7 score in total subjects. For depression, MiWAS identified 17 significant mtSNPs for self-reported depression and 14 significant mtSNPs for PHQ-9 scores. 17 significant mtDNA associations (2 for self-reported depression and 15 for PHQ-9 score) was identified, such as m.14869G{\textgreater}A(
              MT-CYB
              ;
              P

              ) associated with self-reported depression and m.4561T{\textgreater}C (
              MT-ND2
              ;
              P
              value = 3.02 × 10
              −8
              ) associated with PHQ-9 score in all subjects. In addition, 5 common mtDNA shared with anxiety and depression were found in MiWAS, and 4 common mtDNA variants were detected to interact with CRP for anxiety and depression, such as m.9899T{\textgreater}C(
              MT-CO3
              ). Our study suggests the important interaction effects of mitochondrial function and CRP on the risks of anxiety and depression.},

            Within a dominance hierarchy, low social status strongly reduces individual well-being. In socially living species, rank in a hierarchy is determined through competitive encounters. Despite the numerous health consequences, the ability of personality traits to predispose individuals to a particular social rank remains largely unclear. Our work identifies trait anxiety as a predisposing factor to a subordinate rank. We demonstrate that mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens, a brain region relevant for motivation and depression, is a critical mediating factor in the subordinate status displayed by high-anxious rats. These findings highlight a role for cerebral energy metabolism in social behavior and point to mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens as a potential marker and avenue of treatment for mood disorders.

            Dominance hierarchies are integral aspects of social groups, yet whether personality traits may predispose individuals to a particular rank remains unclear. Here we show that trait anxiety directly influences social dominance in male outbred rats and identify an important mediating role for mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens. High-anxious animals that are prone to become subordinate during a social encounter with a low-anxious rat exhibit reduced mitochondrial complex I and II proteins and respiratory capacity as well as decreased ATP and increased ROS production in the nucleus accumbens. A causal link for these findings is indicated by pharmacological approaches. In a dyadic contest between anxiety-matched animals, microinfusion of specific mitochondrial complex I or II inhibitors into the nucleus accumbens reduced social rank, mimicking the low probability to become dominant observed in high-anxious animals. Conversely, intraaccumbal infusion of nicotinamide, an amide form of vitamin B3 known to enhance brain energy metabolism, prevented the development of a subordinate status in high-anxious individuals. We conclude that mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens is crucial for social hierarchy establishment and is critically involved in the low social competitiveness associated with high anxiety. Our findings highlight a key role for brain energy metabolism in social behavior and point to mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens as a potential marker and avenue of treatment for anxiety-related social disorders.},

            Current research implicates pre- and probiotic supplementation as a potential tool for improving symptomology in physical and mental ailments, which makes it an attractive concept for clinicians and consumers alike. Here we focus on the transitional period of late adolescence and early adulthood during which effective interventions, such as nutritional supplementation to influence the gut microbiota, have the potential to offset health-related costs in later life. We examined multiple indices of mood and well-being in 64 healthy females in a 4-week double blind, placebo controlled galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) prebiotic supplement intervention and obtained stool samples at baseline and follow-up for gut microbiota sequencing and analyses. We report effects of the GOS intervention on self-reported high trait anxiety, attentional bias, and bacterial abundance, suggesting that dietary supplementation with a GOS prebiotic may improve indices of pre-clinical anxiety. Gut microbiota research has captured the imagination of the scientific and lay community alike, yet we are now at a stage where this early enthusiasm will need to be met with rigorous research in humans. Our work makes an important contribution to this effort by combining a psychobiotic intervention in a human sample with comprehensive behavioural and gut microbiota measures.},

	abstract = {Neurotransmitters (NTs) are biologically active chemicals, which mediate the electrochemical transmission between neurons. NTs control numerous organic functions particularly crucial for life, including movement, emotional responses, and the physical ability to feel pleasure and pain. These molecules are synthesized from simple, very common precursors. Many types of NTs have both excitatory and inhibitory effects. Neurotransmitters’ imbalance can cause many diseases and disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease, depression, insomnia, increased anxiety, memory loss, etc. Natural food sources containing NTs and/or their precursors would be a potential option to help maintain the balance of NTs to prevent brain and psychiatric disorders. The level of NTs could be influenced, therefore, by targeting dietary habits and nutritional regimens. The progressive implementation of nutritional approaches in clinical practice has made it necessary to infer more about some of the nutritional NTs in neuropsychiatry. However, the importance of the intake of nutritional NTs requires further understanding, since there are no prior significant studies about their bioavailability, clinical significance, and effects on nerve cells. Interventional strategies supported by evidence should be encouraged.},

Its core symptoms, including difficulties regulating attention, activity level, and impulses, appear in early childhood and can persist throughout the lifespan. Current pharmacological options targeting catecholamine neurotransmissions have effectively alleviated symptoms in some, but not all affected individuals, leaving clinicians to implement trial-and-error approach to treatment. In this review, we discuss recent experimental evidence from both preclinical and human studies that suggest imbalance of excitation/inhibition (E/I) in the fronto-striatal circuitry during early development may lead to enduring neuroanatomical abnormality of the circuitry, causing persistence of ADHD symptoms in adulthood. We propose a model of precision medicine care that includes E/I balance as a candidate biomarker for ADHD, development of GABA-modulating medications, and use of magnetic resonance spectroscopy and scalp electrophysiology methods to monitor the effects of treatments on shifting E/I balance throughout the lifespan.},

	abstract = {Neuronal excitation-inhibition (E/I) balance is essential for maintaining neuronal stability and proper brain functioning. Disruptions in this balance are implicated in various neurological disorders, including autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia and epilepsy. The E/I balance is thought to be primarily mediated by intrinsic excitability, governed by an array of voltage-gated ion channels, and extrinsic excitability, maintained through a counterbalance between excitatory synaptic transmission primarily mediated by excitatory transmitter glutamate acting on excitatory ion-tropic glutamate receptors and inhibitory synaptic transmissions chiefly mediated by GABA or glycine acting on their respective inhibitory ion-tropic receptors. However, recent studies reveal that neurotransmitters can exhibit interactions that extend beyond their traditional targets, leading to a phenomenon called neurotransmitter-receptor crosstalk. Examples of such crosstalks include earlier discovery of inhibitory glycine functioning as co-transmitter gating on the NMDA subtype of excitatory glutamate receptor, and the most recent demonstration that shows the excitatory glutamate transmitter binds to the inhibitory GABAA receptor, thereby allosterically potentiating its inhibitory function. These studies demonstrate structurally and physiologically important crosstalk between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission, blurring the distinction between the concepts of classic excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission. In this article, evidence supporting the forms of excitatory and inhibitory crosstalks will be briefly summarized and their underlying mechanisms will be discussed. Furthermore, this review will discuss the implications of these crosstalks in maintaining the E/I balance, as well as their potential involvement in synaptic plasticity and cognition in the context of social conditions.},

	abstract = {Zinc is an essential metal to life. This transition metal is a structural component of many proteins and is actively involved in the catalytic activity of cell enzymes. In either case, these zinc-containing proteins are metalloproteins. However, the amino acid residues that serve as ligands for metal coordination are not necessarily the same in structural proteins compared to enzymes. While crystals of structural proteins that bind zinc reveal a higher preference for cysteine sulfhydryls rather than histidine imidazole rings, catalytic enzymes reveal the opposite, i.e., a greater preference for the histidines over cysteines for catalysis, plus the influence of carboxylic acids. Based on this paradigm, we reviewed the putative ligands of zinc in ionotropic receptors, where zinc has been described as an allosteric modulator of channel receptors. Although these receptors do not strictly qualify as metalloproteins since they do not normally bind zinc in structural domains, they do transitorily bind zinc at allosteric sites, modifying transiently the receptor channel’s ion permeability. The present contribution summarizes current information showing that zinc allosteric modulation of receptor channels occurs by the preferential metal coordination to imidazole rings as well as to the sulfhydryl groups of cysteine in addition to the carboxyl group of acid residues, as with enzymes and catalysis. It is remarkable that most channels, either voltage-sensitive or transmitter-gated receptor channels, are susceptible to zinc modulation either as positive or negative regulators.},

Results of recent research and controlled studies, based on a PubMed search, are emphasized and compared with earlier reports. The recent increase of interest in this form of therapy for ADHD, and especially in the use of omega supplements, significance of iron deficiency, and the avoidance of the “Western pattern” diet, make the discussion timely.
            Diets to reduce symptoms associated with ADHD include sugar-restricted, additive/preservative-free, oligoantigenic/elimination, and fatty acid supplements. Omega−3 supplement is the latest dietary treatment with positive reports of efficacy, and interest in the additive-free diet of the 1970s is occasionally revived. A provocative report draws attention to the ADHD-associated “Western-style” diet, high in fat and refined sugars, and the ADHD-free “healthy” diet, containing fiber, folate, and omega-3 fatty acids.
            The literature on diets and ADHD, listed by PubMed, is reviewed with emphasis on recent controlled studies. Recommendations for the use of diets are based on current opinion of published reports and our practice experience. Indications for dietary therapy include medication failure, parental or patient preference, iron deficiency, and, when appropriate, change from an ADHD-linked Western diet to an ADHD-free healthy diet. Foods associated with ADHD to be avoided and those not linked with ADHD and preferred are listed.
            In practice, additive-free and oligoantigenic/elimination diets are time-consuming and disruptive to the household; they are indicated only in selected patients. Iron and zinc are supplemented in patients with known deficiencies; they may also enhance the effectiveness of stimulant therapy. In patients failing to respond or with parents opposed to medication, omega-3 supplements may warrant a trial. A greater attention to the education of parents and children in a healthy dietary pattern, omitting items shown to predispose to ADHD, is perhaps the most promising and practical complementary or alternative treatment of ADHD.},

However, the reported associations between ADHD and single nutrient intake are inconsistent. The aim of the study was to investigate the relationships between dietary intake changes and the prevalence of ADHD over time with repeat measurements using data from the Children Health and Environment Research (CHEER). To assess changes over time, we used data obtained in 2006 and 2008 (Phases 1 and 2). In this study, there were 2899 children aged 8 years or older in Phase 1 and 2120 children aged 9 years or older in Phase 2 from Korea, and the ADHD scores and dietary intake of 1733 children in Phases 1 and 2 were used in the final analysis. The YN group refers to children whose disease had improved in Phase 2, and the NY group refers to children diagnosed with ADHD in Phase 2. A notable within-group result was the increase in vegetable protein (p = 0.03) in the YN group. A between-group comparison showed that significant changes in nutrient intake could be confirmed most in the NY group, and the YN group tended to have a lower nutrient intake than the NY group. In the correlation of changes in nutrient intake and three subtypes (combined, AD, and HD), the total fat (p = 0.048) and animal protein (p = 0.099) showed a positive correlation with the prevalence of AD. Vegetable iron (p = 0.061 and p = 0.044, respectively), zinc (p = 0.022 and p = 0.007, respectively), vegetable protein (p = 0.074), and calcium (p = 0.057) had inhibitory effects on ADHD and its subtype. In conclusion, management of dietary and nutritional status should be considered to ameliorate ADHD and its subtypes in school-age children, and these relationships require further exploration in other settings.},

	abstract = {This article is intended to provide a comprehensive overview of the role of dietary methods for treatment of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) when pharmacotherapy has proven unsatisfactory or unacceptable. Results of recent research and controlled studies, based on a PubMed search, are emphasized and compared with earlier reports. The recent increase of interest in this form of therapy for ADHD, and especially in the use of omega supplements, significance of iron deficiency, and the avoidance of the “Western pattern” diet, make the discussion timely.
            Diets to reduce symptoms associated with ADHD include sugar-restricted, additive/preservative-free, oligoantigenic/elimination, and fatty acid supplements. Omega−3 supplement is the latest dietary treatment with positive reports of efficacy, and interest in the additive-free diet of the 1970s is occasionally revived. A provocative report draws attention to the ADHD-associated “Western-style” diet, high in fat and refined sugars, and the ADHD-free “healthy” diet, containing fiber, folate, and omega-3 fatty acids.
            The literature on diets and ADHD, listed by PubMed, is reviewed with emphasis on recent controlled studies. Recommendations for the use of diets are based on current opinion of published reports and our practice experience. Indications for dietary therapy include medication failure, parental or patient preference, iron deficiency, and, when appropriate, change from an ADHD-linked Western diet to an ADHD-free healthy diet. Foods associated with ADHD to be avoided and those not linked with ADHD and preferred are listed.
            In practice, additive-free and oligoantigenic/elimination diets are time-consuming and disruptive to the household; they are indicated only in selected patients. Iron and zinc are supplemented in patients with known deficiencies; they may also enhance the effectiveness of stimulant therapy. In patients failing to respond or with parents opposed to medication, omega-3 supplements may warrant a trial. A greater attention to the education of parents and children in a healthy dietary pattern, omitting items shown to predispose to ADHD, is perhaps the most promising and practical complementary or alternative treatment of ADHD.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES:
              Although attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been related to nutrient deficiencies and “unhealthy” diets, to date there are no studies that examined the relationship between the Mediterranean diet and ADHD. We hypothesized that a low adherence to a Mediterranean diet would be positively associated with an increase in ADHD diagnosis.
            
            
              METHODS:
              A total of 120 children and adolescents (60 with newly diagnosed ADHD and 60 controls) were studied in a sex- and age-matched case-control study. ADHD diagnosis was made according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision. Energy, dietary intake, adherence to a Mediterranean diet, and familial background were measured. Logistic regression was used to determine associations between the adherence to a Mediterranean diet and ADHD.
            
            
              RESULTS:
              Lower adherence to a Mediterranean diet was associated with ADHD diagnosis (odds ratio: 7.07; 95\% confidence interval: 2.65–18.84; relative risk: 2.80; 95\% confidence interval: 1.54–5.25). Both remained significant after adjusting for potential confounders. Lower frequency of consuming fruit, vegetables, pasta, and rice and higher frequency of skipping breakfast and eating at fast-food restaurants were associated with ADHD diagnosis (P \&lt; .05). High consumption of sugar, candy, cola beverages, and noncola soft drinks (P \&lt; .01) and low consumption of fatty fish (P \&lt; .05) were also associated with a higher prevalence of ADHD diagnosis.
            
            
              CONCLUSIONS:
              Although these cross-sectional associations do not establish causality, they raise the question of whether low adherence to a Mediterranean diet might play a role in ADHD development. Our data support the notion that not only “specific nutrients” but also the “whole diet” should be considered in ADHD.},

	issn = {0964-7058},
	abstract = {Lycopene is the main carotenoid in tomatoes and it has been hypothesised to be responsible for reducing the risk of some cancers and heart disease. The cooking of tomatoes with olive oil is a characteristic combination in the Southern Mediterranean diet. Previous studies have shown that the absorption of lycopene is greater from processed tomatoes than fresh tomatoes, since the processing breaks down the tomato cell matrix and makes the lycopene more available. The aim of the present study was to determine whether consumption of diced tomatoes cooked with olive oil resulted in higher plasma lycopene concentrations than consumption of diced tomatoes cooked without olive oil. Plasma lycopene concentrations were measured after 5 days on a low lycopene diet and again after a five-day dietary intervention, in healthy subjects, who consumed one meal per day of tomatoes (470 g) cooked with or without extra virgin olive oil (25 ml olive oil). There was an 82\% increase in plasma trans-lycopene (P{\textless} 0.001) and a 40\% in cis-lycopene (P = 0.002) concentrations in the 11 subjects who consumed tomatoes cooked in olive oil. There was no significant change in trans-lycopene (P = 0.684) and a 15\% increase in cis-lycopene (P = 0.007) concentrations in 12 subjects consuming tomatoes cooked without olive oil. We conclude that the addition of olive oil to diced tomatoes during cooking greatly increases the absorption of lycopene. The results highlight the importance of cuisine (i.e how a food is prepared and consumed) in determining the bioavailability of dietary carotenoids such as lycopene.},

Three intervention studies using MRI indicated that 10 mg lutein intake over 12 months had a positive impact on healthy older adults’ brain activities during learning, resting-state connectivity, and gray matter volumes. Four cross-sectional studies using MRI suggested that lutein was positively associated with brain structure and neural efficiency during cognitive tasks. Conclusion: Although only nine studies that used similar datasets were reviewed, this systematic review indicates that lutein has beneficial effects on healthy older adults’ brain health.},

              With the application of genetic and molecular biology techniques, there has been substantial progress in understanding how vitamins are transferred across the mammalian blood–brain barrier and choroid plexus into brain and CSF and how vitamin homeostasis in brain is achieved. In most cases (with the exception of the sodium‐dependent multivitamin transporter for biotin, pantothenic acid, and lipoic acid), the vitamins are transported by separate carriers through the blood–brain barrier or choroid plexus. Then the vitamins are accumulated by brain cells by separate, specialized systems. This review focuses on six vitamins (B

              , pantothenic acid, biotin, and E) and the newer genetic information including relevant ‘knockdown’ or ‘knockout’ models in mice and humans. The overall objective is to integrate this newer information with previous physiological and biochemical observations to achieve a better understanding of vitamin transport and homeostasis in brain. This is especially important in view of the newly described non‐cofactor vitamin roles in brain (e.g. of B

Brain and central nervous system tissues require adequate nutrient levels to function. Many nutrients are concentrated in the cerebrospinal fluid relative to the serum in healthy individuals, and other nutrients resist depletion in the presence of whole-body nutrient depletion. The endothelial, epithelial, and arachnoid brain barriers work in concert to selectively transport, concentrate, and maintain levels of the specific nutrients required by the brain while also blocking the passage of blood-borne toxins and pathogens to brain and central nervous system tissues. These barriers preserve nutrient levels within the brain and actively concentrate nutrients within the cerebrospinal fluid and brain. The roles of physical and energetic barriers, including the blood–brain and blood–nerve barriers, in maintaining brain nutrient levels in health and disease are discussed.},

            Enriching brain DHA is believed to be beneficial for the prevention and treatment of several neurological diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease. An impediment in assessing the effectiveness of the treatments is the lack of a reliable biomarker for brain DHA. The commonly used erythrocyte omega-3 index is not suitable for brain because of the involvement of unique transporter at the blood brain barrier (BBB). We recently showed that dietary lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC)-DHA significantly increases brain DHA, which results in increase of brain BDNF. Since there is bidirectional transport of BDNF through the BBB, we tested the hypothesis that plasma BDNF may be used as biomarker for brain DHA enrichment. We altered the brain DHA in rats and mice over a wide range using different dietary carriers of DHA, and the correlations between the increase in brain omega-3 index with the increases in plasma BDNF and the erythrocyte index were determined. Whereas the increase in brain omega-3 index positively correlated with the increase in plasma BDNF, it negatively correlated with the erythrocyte index. These results show that the plasma BDNF is more reliable than the erythrocyte index as biomarker for assessing the effectiveness of omega-3 supplements in improving brain function.},

              Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder that often persists into adulthood and is accompanied by comorbid mental health problems. This cross-sectional cohort study analyzed 411 18-year-olds from the Danish COPSAC
              2000
              birth cohort to investigate the relationship between the gut microbiome, fasting and postprandial systemic inflammation, ADHD symptoms, and symptoms of anxiety, stress, and depression. ADHD was assessed using the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS), while depression, stress, and anxiety were evaluated with the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale 21 (DASS-21). Fecal metagenomic data and inflammation levels, measured as glycosylated protein A (GlycA), were analyzed following a standardized meal challenge. In males, higher ADHD symptom scores correlated significantly with increased abundance of a tryptophan biosynthesis pathway (MetaCyc Metabolic Pathways Database) and elevated fasting and postprandial GlycA levels (
              p
               {\textless} 0.05). While the severity of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms showed weak associations with GlycA and the gut microbiome, our findings indicate a significant link between ADHD symptoms and postprandial inflammation, warranting further investigation into underlying mechanisms.},

              vitamers also play other cellular roles, for example, as antioxidants, modifying expression and action of steroid hormone receptors, affecting immune function, as chaperones and as an antagonist of Adenosine‐5'‐triphosphate (ATP) at P2 purinoceptors. Because of the vital role of PLP in neurotransmitter metabolism, particularly synthesis of the inhibitory transmitter γ‐aminobutyric acid, it is not surprising that various inborn errors leading to PLP deficiency manifest as B

	abstract = {Chronic, low level exposure to toxic metals is an increasing global problem. The symptoms associated with the slow accumulation of toxic metals are multiple and rather nondescript, and overt expression of toxic effects may not appear until later in life. The sulfhydryl-reactive metals (mercury, cadmium, lead, arsenic) are particularly insidious and can affect a vast array of biochemical and nutritional processes. The primary mechanisms by which the sulfhydryl-reactive metals elicit their toxic effects are summarized. The pro-oxidative effects of the metals are compounded by the fact that the metals also inhibit antioxidative enzymes and deplete intracellular glutathione. The metals also have the potential to disrupt the metabolism and biological activities of many proteins due to their high affinity for free sulfhydryl groups. Cysteine has a pivotal role in inducible, endogenous detoxication mechanisms in the body, and metal exposure taxes cysteine status. The protective effects of glutathione and the metallothioneins are discussed in detail. Basic research pertaining to the transport of toxic metals into the brain is summarized, and a case is made for the use of hydrolyzed whey protein to support metal detoxification and neurological function. Metal exposure also affects essential element status, which can further decrease antioxidation and detoxification processes. Early detection and treatment of metal burden is important for successful detoxification, and optimization of nutritional status is paramount to the prevention and treatment of metal toxicity.},

                n
                ‐3 PUFA supplementation (Lovaza 465 mg eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) + 375 mg docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)) at “low” (1/day, 900 mg) or “high” (4/day, 3600 mg) dose in healthy individuals (

Recent findings emphasize the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of bioactive natural compounds, such as polyphenols extracted from plants and fruits, and their possible synergistic effect when used in combination with current therapies to improve the prognosis and symptoms of inflammatory rheumatic diseases. Here, we report that Sicilian extra virgin olive oil polyphenol-enriched extracts (PE-EVOOs) reduce intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1 β (IL-1β), in peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from both RA patients and healthy subjects (HSs) treated with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) as a control. HPLC-ESI-MS analysis highlighted that PE-EVOOs are rich in different polyphenolic compounds responsible for many of the observed biological effects. At molecular levels, Western blotting analyses revealed that PE-EVOO treatment is associated with the downregulation of the phosphorylated and active form of the inflammatory transcription factor NF-κB and the pro-inflammatory enzyme cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2). In addition, PE-EVOOs upregulated the transcription factor Nrf2 and its target antioxidant enzyme catalase and manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD). Collectively, these results suggest a possible use of PE-EVOOs as potential adjuvants for the treatment of RA.},

            Food synergy is a concept of linking foods to health. Food consists of mixtures of nutrients, serving as a fuel for the body. When synergistic foods are put together, the evidence for potential health benefits becomes stronger than individual foods. Nutrient deficiency is a known phenomenon in many individuals, and synergy plays a very important role in combating the nutritional deficiency. Today’s consumer expresses high interest to build knowledge on the active role of food in their well-being, as well as in the prevention of non-transmissible chronic diseases. Functional foods and their active compounds play a vital role in preventing chronic diseases, improving immunity, and decreasing infections. The concept of synergy is an overthinking in nutrition research which can enhance effective dietary planning value added to the forthcoming nutrition research. This paper gives an overview of various synergic combinations of food components and their interactions within the food and with the human system to attain ideal health benefits.},

	abstract = {Since the early twentieth century, research on vitamins has revealed their therapeutic potential beyond their role as essential micronutrients. Riboflavin, known as vitamin B2, stands out for its unique characteristics. Despite numerous studies, riboflavin remains vital, with implications for human health. Abundantly present in various foods, riboflavin acts as a coenzyme in numerous enzymatic reactions crucial for human metabolism. Its role in energy production, erythrocyte synthesis, and vitamin metabolism underscores its importance in maintaining homeostasis. The impact of riboflavin extends to neurological function, skin health, and cardiovascular well-being, with adequate levels linked to reduced risks of various ailments. However, inadequate intake or physiological stress can lead to deficiency, a condition that poses serious health risks, including severe complications. This underscores the importance of maintaining sufficient levels of riboflavin for general wellness. The essential role of riboflavin in immune function further emphasises its significance for human health and vitality. This paper examines the diverse effects of riboflavin on health and stresses the importance of maintaining sufficient levels for overall well-being.},

              Background
              Psychiatric disorders and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are heritable, polygenic, and often comorbid conditions, yet knowledge about their potential shared familial risk is lacking. We used family designs and T2DM polygenic risk score (T2DM-PRS) to investigate the genetic associations between psychiatric disorders and T2DM.
            
            
              Methods
              
                We linked 659 906 individuals born in Denmark 1990–2000 to their parents, grandparents, and aunts/uncles using population-based registers. We compared rates of T2DM in relatives of children with and without a diagnosis of any or one of 11 specific psychiatric disorders, including neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders, using Cox regression. In a genotyped sample (iPSYCH2015) of individuals born 1981–2008 (
                n
                = 134 403), we used logistic regression to estimate associations between a T2DM-PRS and these psychiatric disorders.
              
            
            
              Results
              Among 5 235 300 relative pairs, relatives of individuals with a psychiatric disorder had an increased risk for T2DM with stronger associations for closer relatives (parents:hazard ratio = 1.38, 95\% confidence interval 1.35–1.42; grandparents: 1.14, 1.13–1.15; and aunts/uncles: 1.19, 1.16–1.22). In the genetic sample, one standard deviation increase in T2DM-PRS was associated with an increased risk for any psychiatric disorder (odds ratio = 1.11, 1.08–1.14). Both familial T2DM and T2DM-PRS were significantly associated with seven of 11 psychiatric disorders, most strongly with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and conduct disorder, and inversely with anorexia nervosa.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Our findings of familial co-aggregation and higher T2DM polygenic liability associated with psychiatric disorders point toward shared familial risk. This suggests that part of the comorbidity is explained by shared familial risks. The underlying mechanisms still remain largely unknown and the contributions of genetics and environment need further investigation.},

            Mixed results have been reported regarding the link between different types of maternal diabetes and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in offspring. Hence, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to explore these associations. Relevant studies on the subject were retrieved from six major databases, including PubMed, Medline, Embase, Scopus, CINAHL, and PsychINFO. The methodological quality of the included studies was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, and between-study heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic. Subgroup, sensitivity, and meta-regression analyses were conducted to identify the sources of heterogeneity between studies. In total, seventeen observational studies (five case-control and twelve cohort studies) with 18,063,336 study participants were included in the final analysis. Our random-effects meta-analysis revealed that exposure to any form of maternal diabetes was associated with an increased risk of ADHD in children. Specifically, we observed a heightened risk of ADHD in children exposed to gestational diabetes mellitus, any pre-existing diabetes, pre-existing type 1 diabetes mellitus, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Our study suggests that children exposed to diabetes during prenatal development are at a higher risk of developing ADHD. These findings underscore the critical importance of early screening and timely interventions for exposed offspring.},

              High prevalence of Metabolic Syndrome (MS) was found in patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorders. Insulin Resistance (IR) seems to mediate MS role in developing cardiometabolic consequences.
            
            
              Aims
              To investigate the prevalence of MS, and the role of MS components and IR surrogate indexes in determining MS in adult ADHD outpatients.
            
            
              Methods
              In the present cross-sectional study, MS, defined according to the Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (ATP III), and IR surrogate indexes were assessed on a consecutive sample of adult ADHD outpatients. Logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of each ATP III component and IR surrogate index in determining MS.
            
            
              Results
              
                Seventeen out of 158 patients (10.8\%, 95\%CI = 0.064/0.167) fulfilled the ATP-III criteria for MS. A comprehensive comparison with prevalence in the reference population was hindered by the lack of patients over 60 in the study sample, however under this age no significant differences were found. Among MS components, blood triglycerides level (OR = 1.02, 95\%CI=1.01/1.03,
                p
                = 0.001) was the main predictor for MS, followed by diastolic blood pressure (OR = 1.08, 95\%CI=1.01/1.16,

	abstract = {Background:
              Insomnia is common in the elderly and is associated with chronic disease, but use of hypnotics increases the incidence of falls. Montmorency tart cherry juice has improved insomnia by self-report questionnaire.
            
            
              Study Question:
              Is insomnia confirmed by polysomnography and is tryptophan availability a potential mechanism for treating insomnia?
            
            
              Study Design:
              A placebo-controlled balanced crossover study with subjects older than 50 years and insomnia were randomized to placebo (2 weeks) or cherry juice (2 weeks) (240 mL 2 times/d) separated by a 2-week washout.
            
            
              Measures and Outcomes:
              Sleep was evaluated by polysomnography and 5 validated questionnaires. Serum indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), the kynurenine-to-tryptophan ratio, and prostaglandin E2 were measured. In vitro, Caco-2 cells were stimulated with interferon-gamma, and the ability of cherry juice procyanidin to inhibit IDO which degrades tryptophan and stimulates inflammation was measured. The content of procyanidin B-2 and other major anthocyanins in cherry juice were determined.
            
            
              Results:
              
                Eleven subjects were randomized; 3 with sleep apnea were excluded and referred. The 8 completers with insomnia increased sleep time by 84 minutes on polysomnography (
                P
                = 0.0182) and sleep efficiency increased on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (
                P
                = 0.03). Other questionnaires showed no significant differences. The serum kynurenine-to-tryptophan ratio decreased, as did the level of prostaglandin E2 (both
                P
                {\textless} 0.05). In vitro, cherry juice procyanidin B-2 dose-dependently inhibited IDO.
              
            
            
              Conclusions:
              Cherry juice increased sleep time and sleep efficiency. Cherry juice procyanidin B-2 inhibited IDO, increased tryptophan availability, reduced inflammation, and may be partially responsible for improvement in insomnia.},

Brain and central nervous system tissues require adequate nutrient levels to function. Many nutrients are concentrated in the cerebrospinal fluid relative to the serum in healthy individuals, and other nutrients resist depletion in the presence of whole-body nutrient depletion. The endothelial, epithelial, and arachnoid brain barriers work in concert to selectively transport, concentrate, and maintain levels of the specific nutrients required by the brain while also blocking the passage of blood-borne toxins and pathogens to brain and central nervous system tissues. These barriers preserve nutrient levels within the brain and actively concentrate nutrients within the cerebrospinal fluid and brain. The roles of physical and energetic barriers, including the blood–brain and blood–nerve barriers, in maintaining brain nutrient levels in health and disease are discussed.},

              Understanding co‐activation patterns of the hypothalamic‐pituitary‐adrenal axis (HPA) and sympathetic adrenal medullary (SAM) during early adolescence may illuminate risk for development of internalizing and externalizing problems. The present study advances empirical work on the topic by examining SAM‐HPA co‐activation during both the reactivity and recovery phases of the stress response following acute stress exposure. Fourth and fifth grade boys and girls (
              N
               = 149) provided cortisol and alpha‐amylase via saliva at seven times throughout a 95‐min assessment in which they were administered the modified Trier Social Stress Test. Parents reported on adolescents’ life stress, pubertal development, medication use, and externalizing problems. Adolescents reported their own internalizing symptoms. Multiple linear regressions tested both direct and interactive effects of SAM and HPA reactivity and recovery on internalizing and externalizing problems. Results from these analyses showed that whereas SAM and HPA reactivity interacted to predict internalizing symptoms, it was their interaction during the recovery phase that predicted externalizing. Concurrent high SAM and HPA reactivity scores predicted high levels of internalizing and concurrently low SAM and HPA recovery scores predicted high levels of externalizing. Implications of the findings for further study and clinical application are discussed.},

              Cognitive and motor disintegration and other functional disturbances in various neuropsychiatric disorders may be related to inhibitory deficits that may manifest as a persistence or re-expression of primitive reflexes and few recent data suggest that these deficits may occur in Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).
            
            
              Methods:
              We have tested a hypothesis to which extent ADHD symptoms and balance deficits are related to persisting primitive reflexes, such as Asymmetric Tonic Neck Reflex (ATNR) and Symmetric Tonic Neck Reflex (STNR) in 80 medication-naïve children with ADHD (40 boys and 40 girls) in the school age (8–11 years) and compared these data with a control group of 60 children (30 boys and 30 girls).
            
            
              Results:
              These data show new finding that ADHD symptoms and balance deficits are strongly and specifically associated with persistent ATNR in girls and STNR in boys.
            
            
              Conclusions:
              These results provide first evidence in medical literature that ADHD in girls and boys is specifically related to distinguished neurological developmental mechanisms related to disinhibition of primitive reflexes.},

This study examined the effects of a 12-week structured exercise intervention on reflex integration, motor coordination, and socio-behavioral outcomes in these populations. Method: Fifteen children with ASD (13 boys, 2 girls) and twelve with ADHD (8 boys, 4 girls), aged 6–12 years, participated in rhythmic, balance, and coordination-based exercises. Primitive reflexes, including the asymmetrical tonic neck reflex (ATNR), were assessed using standardized protocols, and fine motor coordination was evaluated using the Finger and Thumb Opposition Test (FOT). Behavioral outcomes were measured using the Social Responsiveness Scale-2 (SRS-2) for the ASD group and the Conners 3 for the ADHD group. Results: The ASD group showed significant reductions in left-standing ATNR retention scores (p = 0.012) and improvements in right-hand FOT scores (p = 0.023). In the ADHD group, significant improvements were also observed in right-hand FOT scores (p = 0.007). Furthermore, Conners 3 Total and Global Index scores significantly decreased in the ADHD group (p = 0.016 and 0.020, respectively). Reflex retention patterns appeared broader and more bilateral in ASD than in ADHD, suggesting distinct motor developmental profiles. Conclusions: Short-term rhythmic, balance, and whole-body coordination exercise interventions may support behavioral and motor development in children with ASD and ADHD. Tailored programs emphasizing reflex integration hold promise for clinical and educational applications.},

On bivariate analysis, participants with fatigue were younger, had a higher body mass index, a lower handgrip strength and lower ferritin levels. Participants with fatigue were more frequently women, had a lower educational level, presented more frequently with clinical insomnia, diabetes, anaemia, depression and low thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) values, had a higher consumption of antihistamines, antidepressants and hypnotics, and rated more frequently their health as bad or very bad. Multivariable analysis showed that obesity (OR 1.40 (95\% CI 1.03 to 1.91)), insomnia categories (p value for trend \&lt;0.001), depression (OR 3.26 (95\% CI 2.38 to 4.46)), anaemia (OR 1.70 (95\% CI 1.00 to 2.89)) and low self-rated health status (p value for trend \&lt;0.001) were positively associated with fatigue, while older age (p value for trend 0.002) was negatively associated with fatigue. Conversely, no association was found for diabetes, TSH levels, antihistamines or hypnotics.Conclusion In a population-based sample aged 45–86, fatigue was present in one out of five subjects. Regarding clinical factors, sleep disturbances such as insomnia and sleep apnoea should be assessed first, followed by depression. Regarding biological factors, anaemia should be ruled out, while screening for hypothyroidism is not recommended as a first step. Sleep complaints and fatigue in older subjects are not due to ageing and should prompt identification of the underlying cause.},

                Trans‐diagnostic approaches suggest that key cognitive and behavioural processes maintain symptoms across a wide range of mental health disorders. Fatigue is a common clinical feature of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (
                ADHD
                ) in adulthood; however, empirical data supporting its prevalence are lacking. This study aimed to collate outcomes from outpatient services to (1) investigate the prevalence of fatigue in adults with
                ADHD
                , (2) examine symptoms of
                ADHD
                in adults with chronic fatigue syndrome (
                CFS
                ), and (3) consider secondary clinical characteristics common to both disorder groups.
              
            
            
              Methods
              
                Measures of self‐reported fatigue were compared across groups of adults with

              Tryptophan is catabolized by gut microorganisms resulting in a wide range of metabolites implicated in both beneficial and adverse host effects. How gut microbial tryptophan metabolism is directed towards indole, associated with chronic kidney disease, or towards protective indolelactic acid (ILA) and indolepropionic acid (IPA) is unclear. Here we used in vitro culturing and animal experiments to assess gut microbial competition for tryptophan and the resulting metabolites in a controlled three-species defined community and in complex undefined human faecal communities. The generation of specific tryptophan-derived metabolites was not predominantly determined by the abundance of tryptophan-metabolizing bacteria, but rather by substrate-dependent regulation of specific metabolic pathways. Indole-producing
              Escherichia coli
              and ILA- and IPA-producing
              Clostridium sporogenes
              competed for tryptophan within the three-species community in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, fibre-degrading
              Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron
              affected this competition by cross-feeding monosaccharides to
              E. coli
              . This inhibited indole production through catabolite repression, thus making more tryptophan available to
              C. sporogenes
              , resulting in increased ILA and IPA production. The fibre-dependent reduction in indole was confirmed using human faecal cultures and faecal-microbiota-transplanted gnotobiotic mice. Our findings explain why consumption of fermentable fibres suppresses indole production but promotes the generation of other tryptophan metabolites associated with health benefits.},

	abstract = {Gut microbiota have recently been a topic of great interest in the field of microbiology, particularly their role in normal physiology and its influence on human health in disease. A large body of research has supported the presence of a pathway of communication between the gut and the brain, modulated by gut microbiota, giving rise to the term “microbiota-gut-brain” axis. It is now thought that, through this pathway, microbiota can affect behaviour and modulate brain plasticity and cognitive function in ageing. This review summarizes the evidence supporting the existence of such a connection and possible mechanisms of action whereby microbiota can influence the function of the central nervous system. Since normalisation of gut flora has been shown to prevent changes in behaviour, we further postulate on possible therapeutic targets to intervene with cognitive decline in ageing. The research poses various limitations, for example uncertainty about how this data translates to broad human populations. Nonetheless, the microbiota-gut-brain axis is an exciting field worthy of further investigation, particularly with regards to its implications on the ageing population.},

Apple vinegar samples were analyzed to identify their electrical conductivity, pH, titratable acidity, total dry matter, Brix, density, mineral elements, polyphenols, flavonoids, and vitamin C. The antioxidant activity of apple vinegar samples was evaluated using two tests, total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and DPPH radical scavenging activity. Finally, we determined α-glucosidase and α-amylase inhibitory activities of artisanal and industrial apple vinegar. The results showed the following values: pH (3.69–3.19); electrical conductivity (2.81–2.79 mS/cm); titratable acidity (3.6–5.4); ash (4.61–2.90); °Brix (6.37–5.2); density (1.02476–1.02012), respectively, for artisanal apple vinegar and industrial apple vinegar. Concerning mineral elements, potassium was the most predominant element followed by sodium, magnesium, and calcium. Concerning bioactive compounds (polyphenols, flavonoids, and vitamin C), the apple vinegar produced by the artisanal method was the richest sample in terms of bioactive compounds and had the highest α-glucosidase and α-amylase inhibition. The findings of this study showed that the quality and biological activities of artisanal apple vinegar were more important than industrial apple vinegar.},

For example, apigenin improves learning and memory in older mice, reduces tumor proliferation in a mouse xenograft model of triple-negative breast cancer, and induces sedative effects in mice and rats. Moreover, apigenin elongates survival in fly models of neurodegenerative disease and apigenin glycosides increase lifespan in worms. Apigenin’s therapeutic potential is underscored by human clinical studies using chamomile extract, which contains apigenin as an active ingredient. Collectively, chamomile extract has been reported to alleviate anxiety, improve mood, and relieve pain. Furthermore, dietary apigenin intake positively correlates with sleep quality in a large cohort of adults. Apigenin’s electron-rich flavonoid structure gives it strong bonding capacity to diverse molecular structures across receptors and enzymes. The effects of apigenin extend beyond CD38 inhibition, encompassing agonistic and antagonistic modulation of various targets, including GABA and inflammatory pathways. Cumulatively, a large body of evidence positions apigenin as a unique molecule capable of influencing both aging and sleep. Further studies are warranted to better understand apigenin’s nuanced mechanisms and clinical potential.},

Although the effect of endotoxin on the human immune system is well known, its long-term impact on the human body, lasting many months or even years, is unknown. This is due to the difficulty of conducting in vitro and in vivo studies on the prolonged effect of endotoxin on the central nervous system. In this article, based on the available literature, we traced the path of endotoxin from the intestines to the blood through the intestinal epithelium and factors promoting the development of metabolic endotoxemia. The presence of endotoxin in the bloodstream and the inflammation it induces may contribute to lowering the blood–brain barrier, potentially allowing its penetration into the central nervous system; although, the theory is still controversial.

	abstract = {Background
              Probiotics play a vital role in treating immune and inflammatory diseases by improving intestinal barrier function; however, a comprehensive evaluation is missing. The present study aimed to explore the impact of probiotics on the intestinal barrier and related immune function, inflammation, and microbiota composition. A systematic review and meta-analyses were conducted.
            
            
              Methods
              Four major databases (PubMed, Science Citation Index Expanded, CENTRAL, and Embase) were thoroughly searched. Weighted mean differences were calculated for continuous outcomes with corresponding 95\% confidence intervals (CIs), heterogeneity among studies was evaluated utilizing I2 statistic (Chi-Square test), and data were pooled using random effects meta-analyses.
            
            
              Results
              Meta-analysis of data from a total of 26 RCTs (n = 1891) indicated that probiotics significantly improved gut barrier function measured by levels of TER (MD, 5.27, 95\% CI, 3.82 to 6.72, P \&lt; 0.00001), serum zonulin (SMD, -1.58, 95\% CI, -2.49 to -0.66, P = 0.0007), endotoxin (SMD, -3.20, 95\% CI, -5.41 to -0.98, P = 0.005), and LPS (SMD, -0.47, 95\% CI, -0.85 to -0.09, P = 0.02). Furthermore, probiotic groups demonstrated better efficacy over control groups in reducing inflammatory factors, including CRP, TNF-α, and IL-6. Probiotics can also modulate the gut microbiota structure by boosting the enrichment of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus.
            
            
              Conclusion
              The present work revealed that probiotics could improve intestinal barrier function, and alleviate inflammation and microbial dysbiosis. Further high-quality RCTs are warranted to achieve a more definitive conclusion.

The gut epithelium is an efficient barrier that prevents the absorption of liposaccharide (LPS). Structural changes to the intestinal epithelium in response to dietary alterations allow LPS to enter the bloodstream, resulting in an increase in the plasma levels of LPS (termed metabolic endotoxemia). LPS activates Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) leading to the production of numerous pro-inflammatory cytokines and, hence, low-grade systemic inflammation. Thus, metabolic endotoxemia can lead to several chronic inflammatory conditions. Obesity, diabetes, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) can also cause an increase in gut permeability and potential pharmacological and dietary interventions could be used to reduce the chronic low-grade inflammation associated with endotoxemia.},

Even though the use of antidepressants revolutionized the management of depression and had a tremendous positive impact on the patient's outcome, a significant proportion of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) show no or partial or response even with adequate treatment. Given the limitations of the prevailing monoamine hypothesis-based pharmacotherapy, glutamate and glutamatergic related pathways may offer an alternative and a complementary option for designing novel intervention strategies. Over the past few decades, there has been a growing interest in understanding the neurobiological underpinnings of glutamatergic dysfunctions in the pathogenesis of depressive disorders and the development of new pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment options. There is a growing body of evidence for the efficacy of neuromodulation techniques, including transcranial magnetic stimulation, transcutaneous direct current stimulation, transcranial alternating current stimulation, and photo-biomodulation on improving connectivity and neuroplasticity associated with depression. This review attempts to revisit the role of glutamatergic neurotransmission in the etiopathogenesis of depressive disorders and review the current neuroimaging, neurophysiological and clinical evidence of these neuromodulation techniques in the pathophysiology and treatment of depression.},

While alterations in gut–brain interactions have clearly been established in irritable bowel syndrome, a causative role of the microbiome in irritable bowel syndrome remains to be determined. In the absence of specific microbial targets for more effective therapies, current approaches are limited to dietary interventions and centrally targeted pharmacological and behavioral approaches.

	abstract = {Exercise induces beneficial responses in the brain, which is accompanied by an increase in BDNF, a trophic factor associated with cognitive improvement and the alleviation of depression and anxiety. However, the exact mechanisms whereby physical exercise produces an induction in brain Bdnf gene expression are not well understood. While pharmacological doses of HDAC inhibitors exert positive effects on Bdnf gene transcription, the inhibitors represent small molecules that do not occur in vivo. Here, we report that an endogenous molecule released after exercise is capable of inducing key promoters of the Mus musculus Bdnf gene. The metabolite β-hydroxybutyrate, which increases after prolonged exercise, induces the activities of Bdnf promoters, particularly promoter I, which is activity-dependent. We have discovered that the action of β-hydroxybutyrate is specifically upon HDAC2 and HDAC3, which act upon selective Bdnf promoters. Moreover, the effects upon hippocampal Bdnf expression were observed after direct ventricular application of β-hydroxybutyrate. Electrophysiological measurements indicate that β-hydroxybutyrate causes an increase in neurotransmitter release, which is dependent upon the TrkB receptor. These results reveal an endogenous mechanism to explain how physical exercise leads to the induction of BDNF.
          , 
            Exercise is not only good for our physical health but it benefits our mental health and abilities too. Physical exercise can affect how much of certain proteins are made in the brain. In particular, the levels of a protein called brain derived neurotrophic factor (or BDNF for short) increase after exercise. BDNF has already been shown to enhance mental abilities at the same time as acting against anxiety and depression in mice, and might act in similar way in humans. Nevertheless, it is currently not clear how exercise increases the production of BDNF by cells in the brain.
            Sleiman et al. have now investigated this question by comparing mice that were allowed to use a running wheel for 30 days with control mice that did not exercise. The comparison showed that the exercising mice had higher levels of BDNF in their brains than the control mice, which confirms the results of previous studies. Next, biochemical experiments showed that this change occurred when enzymes known as histone deacetylases stopped inhibiting the production of BDNF. Therefore Sleiman et al. hypothesised that exercise might produce a chemical that itself inhibits the histone deacetylases.
            Indeed, the exercising mice produced more of a molecule called β-hydroxybutyrate in their livers, which travels through the blood into the brain where it could inhibit histone deacetylases. Further experiments showed that injecting β-hydroxybutyrate directly into the brains of mice led to increase in BDNF.
            These new findings reveal with molecular detail one way in which exercise can affect the expression of proteins in the brain. This new understanding may provide ideas for new therapies to treat psychiatric diseases, such as depression, and neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease.},

	abstract = {Background
Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder with complex genetic and environmental underpinnings. Emerging evidence suggests a significant role of gut microbiota in ADHD pathophysiology. This study investigates variations in gut microbiota composition and Short-Chain Fatty Acid (SCFA) profiles between children and adolescents with ADHD and healthy controls.
Methods
The study included 42 ADHD patients and 31 healthy controls, aged 6–18 years. Fecal samples were analyzed for microbial composition using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and for SCFA profiles through gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The study assessed both α and β diversity of gut microbiota and quantified various SCFAs to compare between the groups.
Results
ADHD subjects demonstrated significantly reduced gut microbiota diversity, as indicated by lower α-diversity indices (Shannon index, Observed species, Faith PD index) and a trend towards significance in β-diversity (Weighted UniFrac). Notably, the ADHD group exhibited significantly lower levels of key SCFAs, including acetic, propionic, isobutyric, isovaleric, and valeric acids, highlighting a distinct microbial and metabolic profile in these individuals.
Conclusion
This study uncovers significant alterations in gut microbiota and SCFA profiles in children with ADHD, compared to healthy controls. The observed changes in SCFAs, known for their associations with other behavioral and neurologic pathologies, and for their role in neural signaling. These findings offer a metabolite fingerprint that could potentially lead to novel diagnostic and treatment approaches for ADHD, emphasizing the importance of gut microbiota in the disorder’s pathogenesis and management.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are at a higher risk of depression and lower quality of life (QoL); however, it is unclear whether disrupted sleep and circadian rhythms mediate this increased risk.
OBJECTIVES: We investigated whether disruption of self-reported sleep and circadian factors mediate the associations of ADHD traits with depression symptom severity and QoL.
METHODS: 1364 participants (mean: 51.86 (SD=0.37) years, 75\% women) from a large-scale cross-sectional online survey (Netherlands Sleep Registry) completed a sociodemographic questionnaire, the Adult ADHD Rating Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Satisfaction With Life Scale (SLS) and Cantril Ladder (CL) (QoL measures), Insomnia Severity Index, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Munich Chronotype Questionnaire.
FINDINGS: Higher ADHD traits were significantly associated with depression symptom severity (p=0.03), lower QoL (p{\textless}0.001), insomnia severity (p{\textless}0.001), lower sleep quality (p{\textless}0.001) and later chronotype (p=0.01). No sleep or circadian factor significantly mediated the association of the severity of symptoms of ADHD and depression (all p{\textgreater}0.1). Conversely, only insomnia severity significantly mediated the association of ADHD traits and QoL (SLS: standardised β=-0.10, 95\% CI (-0.12 to -0.04); CL: standardised β=0.103, 95\% CI (0.04 to 0.16)).
CONCLUSION: ADHD traits were associated with lower QoL and it was partially mediated by insomnia severity. Future studies targeting insomnia complaints in this population may help mitigate their depression complaints and improve their QoL.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Our results may help current clinical guidelines that do not typically link sleep/circadian complaints to QoL in ADHD assessment.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            
              The prevalence of somatic insulinopathies, like metabolic syndrome (MetS), obesity, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), is higher in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Dysregulation of insulin signalling has been implicated in these neuropsychiatric disorders, and shared genetic factors might partly underlie this observed multimorbidity. We investigated the genetic overlap between AD, ASD, and OCD with MetS, obesity, and T2DM by estimating pairwise global genetic correlations using the summary statistics of the largest available genome-wide association studies for these phenotypes. Having tested these hypotheses, other potential brain “insulinopathies” were also explored by estimating the genetic relationship of six additional neuropsychiatric disorders with nine insulin-related diseases/traits. Stratified covariance analyses were then performed to investigate the contribution of insulin-related gene sets. Significant negative genetic correlations were found between OCD and MetS (
              r
              g
               = −0.315,
              p
               = 3.9 × 10
              −8
              ), OCD and obesity (
              r
              g
               = −0.379,
              p
               = 3.4 × 10
              −5
              ), and OCD and T2DM (
              r
              g
               = −0.172,
              p
               = 3 × 10
              −4
              ). Significant genetic correlations with insulin-related phenotypes were also found for anorexia nervosa (AN), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), major depressive disorder, and schizophrenia (
              p
               {\textless} 6.17 × 10
              −4
              ). Stratified analyses showed negative genetic covariances between AD, ASD, OCD, ADHD, AN, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and somatic insulinopathies through gene sets related to insulin signalling and insulin receptor recycling, and positive genetic covariances between AN and T2DM, as well as ADHD and MetS through gene sets related to insulin processing/secretion (
              p
               {\textless} 2.06 × 10
              −4
              ). Overall, our findings suggest the existence of two clusters of neuropsychiatric disorders, in which the genetics of insulin-related diseases/traits may exert divergent pleiotropic effects. These results represent a starting point for a new research line on “insulinopathies” of the brain.},

	abstract = {Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder with high heterogeneity that can affect individuals of any age. It is characterized by three main symptoms: inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. These neurobehavioral alterations and neurochemical and pharmacological findings are mainly attributed to unbalanced catecholaminergic signaling, especially involving dopaminergic pathways within prefrontal and striatal areas. Dopamine receptors and transporters are not solely implicated in this imbalance, as evidence indicates that the dopaminergic signaling is modulated by adenosine activity. To this extent, alterations in adenosinergic signaling are probably involved in ADHD. Here, we review the current knowledge about adenosine’s role in the modulation of chemical, behavioral and cognitive parameters of ADHD, especially regarding dopaminergic signaling. Current literature usually links adenosine receptors signaling to the dopaminergic imbalance found in ADHD, but there is evidence that equilibrative nucleoside transporters (ENTs) could also be implicated as players in dopaminergic signaling alterations seen in ADHD, since their involvement in other neurobehavioral impairments.},

	abstract = {Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a persistent neurodevelopmental disorder that affects 5\% of children and adolescents and 2.5\% of adults worldwide. Throughout an individual's lifetime, ADHD can increase the risk of other psychiatric disorders, educational and occupational failure, accidents, criminality, social disability and addictions. No single risk factor is necessary or sufficient to cause ADHD. In most cases ADHD arises from several genetic and environmental risk factors that each have a small individual effect and act together to increase susceptibility. The multifactorial causation of ADHD is consistent with the heterogeneity of the disorder, which is shown by its extensive psychiatric co-morbidity, its multiple domains of neurocognitive impairment and the wide range of structural and functional brain anomalies associated with it. The diagnosis of ADHD is reliable and valid when evaluated with standard criteria for psychiatric disorders. Rating scales and clinical interviews facilitate diagnosis and aid screening. The expression of symptoms varies as a function of patient developmental stage and social and academic contexts. Although there are no curative treatments for ADHD, evidenced-based treatments can markedly reduce its symptoms and associated impairments. For example, medications are efficacious and normally well tolerated, and various non-pharmacological approaches are also valuable. Ongoing clinical and neurobiological research holds the promise of advancing diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to ADHD.

	abstract = {Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) persists in older age and is postulated as a risk factor for cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). However, these findings rely primarily on electronic health records and can present biased estimates of disease prevalence. An obstacle to investigating age-related cognitive decline in ADHD is the absence of large-scale studies following patients with ADHD into older age. Alternatively, this study aimed to determine whether genetic liability for ADHD, as measured by a well-validated ADHD polygenic risk score (ADHD-PRS), is associated with cognitive decline and the development of AD pathophysiology in cognitively unimpaired (CU) older adults. We calculated a weighted ADHD-PRS in 212 CU individuals without a clinical diagnosis of ADHD (55–90 years). These individuals had baseline amyloid-β (Aβ) positron emission tomography, longitudinal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) phosphorylated tau at threonine 181 (p-tau181), magnetic resonance imaging, and cognitive assessments for up to 6 years. Linear mixed-effects models were used to test the association of ADHD-PRS with cognition and AD biomarkers. Higher ADHD-PRS was associated with greater cognitive decline over 6 years. The combined effect between high ADHD-PRS and brain Aβ deposition on cognitive deterioration was more significant than each individually. Additionally, higher ADHD-PRS was associated with increased CSF p-tau181 levels and frontoparietal atrophy in CU Aβ-positive individuals. Our results suggest that genetic liability for ADHD is associated with cognitive deterioration and the development of AD pathophysiology. Findings were mostly observed in Aβ-positive individuals, suggesting that the genetic liability for ADHD increases susceptibility to the harmful effects of Aβ pathology.},

Foods and dietary patterns are the primary drivers in shaping/designing gut microbiota compositions and their metabolites across the lifetime. This indicates the importance of functional molecules present in the food matrix in the life of gut microbiota and their influence on the host's biological system. In this contribution, the effects of different dietary choices and bioactive compounds (i.e., phenolics, vitamins, carotenoids) on gut microbiome compositions and their metabolites are comprehensively discussed by focusing on neurotransmitters. This study may provide useful information that fills a gap in understanding the role of the gut microbiota and its alterations as affected by foods and food-derived bioactives.},

	abstract = {In inflammatory neuropathies, oxidative stress results in neuronal and Schwann cell (SC) death promoting early neurodegeneration and clinical disability. Treatment with the short-chain fatty acid propionate showed a significant immunoregulatory and neuroprotective effect in multiple sclerosis patients. Similar effects have been described for patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). Therefore, Schwann cell's survival and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) outgrowth were evaluated in vitro after propionate treatment and application of H2O2 or S-nitroso-N-acetyl-D-L-penicillamine (SNAP) to evaluate neuroprotection. In addition, DRG resistance was evaluated by the application of oxidative stress by SNAP ex vivo after in vivo propionate treatment. Propionate treatment secondary to SNAP application on DRG served as a neuroregeneration model. Histone acetylation as well as expression of the free fatty acid receptor (FFAR) 2 and 3, histone deacetylases, neuroregeneration markers, and antioxidative mediators were investigated. β-hydroxybutyrate was used as a second FFAR3 ligand, and pertussis toxin was used as an FFAR3 antagonist. FFAR3, but not FFAR2, expression was evident on SC and DRG. Propionate-mediated activation of FFAR3 and histone 3 hyperacetylation resulted in increased catalase expression and increased resistance to oxidative stress. In addition, propionate treatment resulted in enhanced neuroregeneration with concomitant growth-associated protein 43 expression. We were able to demonstrate an antioxidative and neuroregenerative effect of propionate on SC and DRG mediated by FFAR3-induced histone acetylases expression. Our results describe a pathway to achieve neuroprotection/neuroregeneration relevant for patients with immune-mediated neuropathies.},

We hypothesised interactions between circulating gut-derived microbial metabolites, and the blood-brain barrier (BBB) also contribute to the gut-brain axis.

A case-study of the history of dietary fat science and recommendations is presented, summarizing presentations from an Experimental Biology Symposium that addressed techniques for effective scientific communication and used the scientific discourse of public understanding of dietary fats and health as an example of challenges in scientific communication. Decades of dietary recommendations have focused on balancing calorie intake and energy expenditure and decreasing fat. Reducing saturated fat has been a cornerstone of dietary recommendations for cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk reduction. However, evidence from observational studies and randomized clinical trials demonstrates that replacing saturated fat with carbohydrates, specifically refined, has no benefit on CVD risk, while substituting polyunsaturated fats for either saturated fat or carbohydrate reduces risk. A significant body of research supports the unique health benefits of dietary patterns and foods that contain plant and marine sources of unsaturated fats. Yet, after decades of focus on low-fat diets, many consumers, food manufacturers, and restauranteurs remain confused about the role of dietary fats on disease risk and sources of healthy fats. Shifting dietary recommendations to focus on food-based dietary patterns would facilitate translation to the public and potentially remedy widespread misperceptions about what constitutes a healthful dietary pattern.},

We conducted a systematic review followed by a meta-analysis of case-control studies assessing blood or saliva cortisol levels and blood levels of inflammatory biomarkers in youth with ADHD. The effect sizes (ES) were synthesized by using a random-effects model. In the 19 studies on cortisol levels (totaling n = 916 youth with ADHD and n = 947 typically developing (TD), healthy youth), youth with ADHD have lower basal cortisol levels at any time-points during the day (effect size: .68; p = 0.004) and lower cumulative levels of cortisol (ES: .39, p = .008) throughout the day than TD youth. Moreover, morning cortisol levels were lower in ADHD youth when compared with TD youth (14 studies, n = 1679, ES: .84, p = 0.003), while there is no difference for the afternoon cortisol levels (p = 0.48). The meta-analysis on inflammation biomarker was conducted on 4 studies (totaling n = 404 youth) showed that Tumour Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α) was lower in ADHD when compared with TD (3 studies, n = 257 youth, p = 0.004), while no differences for Interleukin-1β(IL-1β) (p = 0.21), IL-6 (p = 0.09) and IL-10 (p = 0.77). The lower cortisol in the context of low TNF-α levels may indicate a specific pattern of biomarkers in ADHD, and further investigation is warranted.},

              Consuming a greater proportion of total energy intake earlier in the day rather than in the evening is proposed to positively influence weight loss and health, potentially due to greater synchronization of human body circadian rhythms. This systematic review provides an update on existing evidence regarding earlier distributed eating patterns in weight loss interventions. Using a robust search strategy in five electronic databases, nine randomized controlled trials investigating the impact of energy intake distribution on weight loss were identified. Following critical appraisal, a random‐effects meta‐analyses found that, in the context of an energy‐reduced diet, distributing energy intake with a focus on earlier intake resulted in significantly greater weight loss (−1.23 kg; 95\% CI 2.40, −0.06,
              p
               = 0.04). Improvements in HOMA‐IR, fasting glucose, and LDL cholesterol were also seen. The current study provides a timely update on the evidence linking distribution of total daily energy intake and health, showing that a focus on earlier intakes can result in greater short‐term weight loss compared with later intakes. Future studies are needed to elucidate the impact that earlier intakes may have on weight management and metabolic health.},

                To investigate the prevalence of insomnia in adults with Attention‐deficit hyperactivity disorder (
                ADHD
                ) and its association with clinical subtypes, current
                ADHD
                symptoms, and stimulant treatment.
              
            
            
              Method
              
                We obtained diagnostic information, symptom rating scales and treatment history from clinically ascertained adult
                ADHD
                patients diagnosed according to
                DSM
                ‐
                IV
                criteria (
                n
                = 268, mean age 38.1 years) and randomly selected population controls (
                n
                = 202, mean age 36.5 years). The Bergen Insomnia Scale (
                BIS
                ) was used to measure insomnia.
                ADHD
                symptom domains were self‐rated using the Adult
                ADHD
                Self‐Rating Scale.
              
            
            
              Results
              
                Insomnia was far more frequent among adults with
                ADHD
                (66.8\%) than in the population controls (28.8\%) (
                P
                {\textless} 0.001). Insomnia was more common in adults with the combined subtype than in those with the inattentive subtype (79.7\% and 55.6\%, respectively) (
                P
                = 0.003). For self‐reported current
                ADHD
                symptoms, inattention was strongly correlated to insomnia. Patients currently using stimulant treatment for
                ADHD
                reported a lower total insomnia score compared to patients without medication (
                P
                {\textless} 0.05).
              
            
            
              Conclusion
              
                Insomnia was highly prevalent among adults with
                ADHD
                . The lower insomnia score in patients on current stimulant treatment suggests that stimulant treatment is not associated with worsening of insomnia symptoms in adult
                ADHD
                patients.},

Like other wake-promoting drugs (stimulants and modafinil), caffeine enhances dopamine (DA) signaling in the brain, which it does predominantly by antagonizing adenosine A

              receptors (A
              2A
              R). However, it is unclear if caffeine, at the doses consumed by humans, increases DA release or whether it modulates the functions of postsynaptic DA receptors through its interaction with adenosine receptors, which modulate them. We used positron emission tomography and [

              Abstract
              
                Although bright light is regarded as the primary circadian zeitgeber, its limitations support exploring alternative zeitgebers. Exercise elicits significant circadian phase‐shifting effects, but fundamental information regarding these effects is needed. The primary aim of the present study was to establish phase–response curves (PRCs) documenting the size and direction of phase shifts in relation to the circadian time of exercise. Aerobically fit older (
                n
                 = 51; 59–75 years) and young adults (
                n
                 = 48; 18–30 years) followed a 90 min laboratory ultrashort sleep–wake cycle (60 min wake/30 min sleep) for up to 5½ days. At the same clock time on three consecutive days, each participant performed 60 min of moderate treadmill exercise (65–75\% of heart rate reserve) at one of eight times of day/night. To describe PRCs, phase shifts were measured for the cosine‐fitted acrophase of urinary 6‐sulphatoxymelatonin (aMT6s), as well as for the evening rise, morning decline and change in duration of aMT6s excretion. Significant PRCs were found for aMT6s acrophase, onset and duration, with peak phase advances corresponding to clock times of 7:00 am and from 1:00 pm to 4:00 pm, delays from 7:00 pm to 10:00 pm, and minimal shifts around 4:00 pm and 2:00 am. There were no significant age or sex differences. The amplitudes of the aMT6s onset and acrophase PRCs are comparable to expectations for bright light of equal duration. The phase advance to afternoon exercise and the exercise‐induced PRC for change in aMT6s duration are novel findings. The results support further research exploring additive phase‐shifting effects of bright light and exercise and health benefits.

	abstract = {Background
              Nearly 3\% of adults have attention-deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), although in the UK, most are undiagnosed. Adults with ADHD on average experience poorer educational and employment outcomes, worse physical and mental health and are more likely to die prematurely. No studies have yet used mortality data to examine the life expectancy deficit experienced by adults with diagnosed ADHD in the UK or worldwide.
            
            
              Aims
              This study used the life-table method to calculate the life-expectancy deficit for people with diagnosed ADHD using data from UK primary care.
            
            
              Method
              A matched cohort study using prospectively collected primary care data (792 general practices, 9 561 450 people contributing eligible person-time from 2000–2019). We identified 30 039 people aged 18+ with diagnosed ADHD, plus a comparison group of 300 390 participants matched (1:10) by age, sex and primary care practice. We used Poisson regression to estimate age-specific mortality rates, and life tables to estimate life expectancy for people aged 18+ with diagnosed ADHD.
            
            
              Results
              Around 0.32\% of adults in the cohort had an ADHD diagnosis, {\textasciitilde}1 in 9 of all adults with ADHD. Diagnoses of common physical and mental health conditions were more common in adults with diagnosed ADHD than the comparison group. The apparent reduction in life expectancy for adults with diagnosed ADHD relative to the general population was 6.78 years (95\% CI: 4.50 to 9.11) for males, and 8.64 years (95\% CI: 6.55 to 10.91) for females.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Adults with diagnosed ADHD are living shorter lives than they should. We believe that this is likely caused by modifiable risk factors and unmet support and treatment needs in terms of both ADHD and co-occurring mental and physical health conditions. This study included data from adults with diagnosed ADHD; the results may not generalise to the entire population of adults with ADHD, the vast majority of whom are undiagnosed.},

	abstract = {The human circadian system has a period of approximately 24 h and studies on the consequences of “chornodisruption” have greatly expanded. Lifestyle and environmental factors of modern societies (i.e., artificial lighting, jetlag, shift work, and around-the-clock access to energy-dense food) can induce disruptions of the circadian system and thereby adversely affect individual health. Growing evidence demonstrates a complex reciprocal relationship between metabolism and the circadian system, in which perturbations in one system affect the other one. From a nutritional genomics perspective, genetic variants in clock genes can both influence metabolic health and modify the individual response to diet. Moreover, an interplay between the circadian rhythm, gut microbiome, and epigenome has been demonstrated, with the diet in turn able to modulate this complex link suggesting a remarkable plasticity of the underlying mechanisms. In this view, the study of the impact of the timing of eating by matching elements from nutritional research with chrono-biology, that is, chrono-nutrition, could have significant implications for personalized nutrition in terms of reducing the prevalence and burden of chronic diseases. This review provides an overview of the current evidence on the interactions between the circadian system and nutrition, highlighting how this link could in turn influence the epigenome and microbiome. In addition, possible nutritional strategies to manage circadian-aligned feeding are suggested.},

              Twelve RCTs with 730 obese or overweight adults were included in this meta-analysis. Early TRE and later TRE both elicited moderate reductions in body weight and insulin resistance (IR) (homeostasis model assessment of IR) when compared to non-TRE. Interestingly, early TRE showed more effectiveness than later TRE in improving IR (early vs later TRE: −0.44; 95\% CI, −0.86 to −0.02; P \&lt; .05), whereas no statistically significant difference was detected in weight loss (early vs later TRE: −0.31 kg; 95\% CI, −1.15 to 0.53 kg; P \&gt;.05). In addition, early TRE rather than later TRE showed significant benefits in glycemic metabolism and blood pressure when compared to non-TRE. No significant differences between early and later TRE were observed for fasting blood glucose, blood pressure, and lipid profiles.
            
            
              Conclusion
              This meta-analysis suggests that people may choose early TRE for more effective weight management and metabolic benefits. Nevertheless, further large-scale RCTs are warranted to verify our findings.},

	abstract = {Introduction:
              Blue light from electronic devices has a bad reputation. It has a wavelength which may influence our circadian rhythm and cause bad sleep. But there are other aspects of blue light exposure which are often overlooked, for example, it may influence performance and wellbeing. However, few resources summarize its effects systematically. Therefore, the goal of this systematic review was to distil the present evidence on blue light exposure and its influence on sleep, performance and wellbeing and discuss its significance for athletes.
            
            
              Methods:
              The databases that were searched were Cochrane, Embase, Pubmed, Scopus, and Virtual Health Library. The studies included investigated the influence of blue light exposure on either sleep, performance, wellbeing or a combination of those parameters on healthy humans. Quality assessment was done based on the quantitative assessment tool “QualSyst.”
            
            
              Results:
              Summarizing the influence of blue light exposure, the following results were found (expressed as proportion to the number of studies investigating the particular parameter): Fifty percent of studies found tiredness to be decreased. One fifth of studies found sleep quality to be decreased and one third found sleep duration to be decreased. Half of the studies found sleep efficacy to be decreased and slightly less than half found sleep latency to be increased. More than one half of the studies found cognitive performance to be increased. Slightly more than two thirds found alertness to be increased and reaction time to be decreased. Slightly less than half of the studies found wellbeing to be increased.
            
            
              Conclusion:
              Blue light exposure can positively affect cognitive performance, alertness, and reaction time. This might benefit sports reliant on team-work and decision-making and may help prevent injury. Blue light might also have negative effects such as the decrease in sleep quality and sleep duration, which might worsen an athlete’s physical and cognitive performance and recovery. Further research should explore if blue light can improve sleep, performance and wellbeing to significantly benefit athletic performance.},

          , 
            Your daily drug resets your clock
            
              Your morning cup of coffee may be shifting your circadian clock. Burke
              et al
              . show that caffeine—widely available, legal, and psychoactive—inserts a delay into the {\textasciitilde}24-hour metabolic rhythm that keeps your body running in time with the world.
            
            In a sensitive, within-subject experimental design, five people were kept under highly controlled conditions for 49 days. Before bedtime, they were given various treatments: either a double-espresso caffeine dose, exposure to bright or dim light, or a placebo. The caffeine delayed their internal clock by 40 min, a shift about half as long as bright light, a stimulus known to robustly lengthen the circadian phase.
            The authors used cultured cells to determine that the drug acted directly on the adenosine receptor, which increases the intracellular messenger molecule cyclic AMP. The fact that cyclic AMP forms a key cog in the inner workings of the clock links caffeine’s biochemical effects to its delay of the circadian rhythm.
            Not only do these results reinforce the common advice to avoid caffeine in the evening, but they also raise the intriguing possibility that caffeine may be useful for resetting the circadian clock to treat jet lag induced by international time zone travel.
          , 
            
              Caffeine’s wakefulness-promoting and sleep-disrupting effects are well established, yet whether caffeine affects human circadian timing is unknown. We show that evening caffeine consumption delays the human circadian melatonin rhythm in vivo and that chronic application of caffeine lengthens the circadian period of molecular oscillations in vitro, primarily with an adenosine receptor/cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP)–dependent mechanism. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, {\textasciitilde}49-day long, within-subject study, we found that consumption of a caffeine dose equivalent to that in a double espresso 3 hours before habitual bedtime induced a {\textasciitilde}40-min phase delay of the circadian melatonin rhythm in humans. This magnitude of delay was nearly half of the magnitude of the phase-delaying response induced by exposure to 3 hours of evening bright light ({\textasciitilde}3000 lux, {\textasciitilde}7 W/m
              2
              ) that began at habitual bedtime. Furthermore, using human osteosarcoma U2OS cells expressing clock gene luciferase reporters, we found a dose-dependent lengthening of the circadian period by caffeine. By pharmacological dissection and small interfering RNA knockdown, we established that perturbation of adenosine receptor signaling, but not ryanodine receptor or phosphodiesterase activity, was sufficient to account for caffeine’s effects on cellular timekeeping. We also used a cyclic AMP biosensor to show that caffeine increased cyclic AMP levels, indicating that caffeine influenced a core component of the cellular circadian clock. Together, our findings demonstrate that caffeine influences human circadian timing, showing one way that the world’s most widely consumed psychoactive drug affects human physiology.},

This study focused on the postprandial blood glucose changes in healthy humans by a systematic review and meta-analysis. They were chosen because of its importance to a prevention from diabetes. The study objective was to examine acute blood glucose concentrations of healthy humans after the meal with and without allulose. The study collected all D-allulose related studies from various databases. A forest plot of the comparison between an allulose intake group and the control group showed both 5g and 10g intake groups have the significantly smaller area under the curve of postprandial blood glucose levels. It means that D-Allulose attenuates postprandial blood glucose concentrations in healthy humans. As the result, D-Allulose is a valuable blood glucose management tool for healthy humans and diabetes patients.

              Epigenetic variation in peripheral tissues is being widely studied as a molecular biomarker of complex disease and disease-related exposures. To date, few studies have examined differences in DNA methylation associated with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In this study, we profiled genetic and methylomic variation across the genome in saliva samples from children (age 7–12 years) with clinically established ADHD (
              N
               = 391) and nonpsychiatric controls (
              N
               = 213). We tested for differentially methylated positions (DMPs) associated with both ADHD diagnosis and ADHD polygenic risk score, by using linear regression models including smoking, medication effects, and other potential confounders in our statistical models. Our results support previously reported associations between ADHD and DNA methylation levels at sites annotated to
              VIPR2
              , and identify several novel disease-associated DMPs (
              p
               {\textless} 1e–5), although none of them were genome-wide significant. The two top-ranked, ADHD-associated DMPs (cg17478313 annotated to
              SLC7A8
              and cg21609804 annotated to
              MARK2
              ) are also significantly associated with nearby SNPs (
              p
               = 1.2e–46 and
              p
               = 2.07e–59), providing evidence that disease-associated DMPs are under genetic control. We also report a genome-wide significant association between ADHD polygenic risk and variable DNA methylation at a site annotated to the promoter of
              GART
              and
              SON
              (
              p
               = 6.71E–8). Finally, we show that ADHD-associated SNPs colocalize with SNPs associated with methylation levels in saliva. This is the first large-scale study of DNA methylation in children with ADHD. Our results represent novel epigenetic biomarkers for ADHD that may be useful for patient stratification, reinforce the importance of genetic effects on DNA methylation, and provide plausible molecular mechanisms for ADHD risk variants.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Early-life lead (Pb) exposure has been linked to adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. Recent evidence has indicated a critical role of DNA methylation (DNAm) in cognition, and Pb exposure has also been shown to alter DNAm. However, it is unknown whether DNAm is part of the mechanism of Pb neurotoxicity. This longitudinal study investigated the associations between trimester-specific (T1, T2, and T3) maternal blood Pb concentrations, gene-specific DNAm in umbilical cord blood, and infant neurodevelopmental outcomes at 12 and 24 months of age (mental development index, psychomotor development index, and behavioral rating scale of orientation/engagement and emotional regulation) among 85 mother–infant pairs from the Early Life Exposure in Mexico to Environmental Toxicants (ELEMENT) study. In the mediation analysis for this pilot study, P \&lt; 0.1 was considered significant. DNAm at a locus in CCSER1 (probe ID cg02901723) mediated the association between T2 Pb on 24-month orientation/engagement [indirect effect estimate 4.44, 95\% confidence interval (−0.09, 10.68), P = 0.06] and emotional regulation [3.62 (−0.05, 8.69), P = 0.05]. Cg18515027 (GCNT1) DNAm mediated the association of T1 Pb [−4.94 (−10.6, −0.77), P = 0.01] and T2 Pb [−3.52 (−8.09, −0.36), P = 0.02] with 24-month EMOCI, but there was a positive indirect effect estimate between T2 Pb and 24-month psychomotor development index [1.25 (−0.11, 3.32), P = 0.09]. The indirect effect was significant for cg19703494 (TRAPPC6A) DNAm in the association between T2 Pb and 24-month mental development index [1.54 (0, 3.87), P = 0.05]. There was also an indirect effect of cg23280166 (VPS11) DNAm on T3 Pb and 24-month EMOCI [2.43 (−0.16, 6.38), P = 0.08]. These associations provide preliminary evidence for gene-specific DNAm as mediators between prenatal Pb and adverse cognitive outcomes in offspring.},

	abstract = {Phytates are a type of organophosphorus compound produced in terrestrial ecosystems by plants. In plant feeds, phytic acid and its salt form, phytate, account for 60\%–80\% of total phosphorus. Because phytate is a polyanionic molecule, it can chelate positively charged cations such as calcium, iron, and zinc. Due to its prevalence in vegetal tissues and the fact that people consume plants, phytate was first considered a potential health benefit. This updated review aims to summarize the current data on the results of clinical trials of phytates on human health, highlighting both beneficial and undesirable effects. To obtain these updated data, published papers in electronic databases such as PubMed/MedLine, TRIP database, Wiley, Google Scholar, Baidu, and Scopus were searched. Study results have shown that phytate can have beneficial health effects such as antioxidant, anticancer potential and reduction of pathological calcifications in blood vessels and organs; but also, negative effects by reducing the absorption of minerals important for maintaining the homeostasis of the human body. According to these recent results derived from recent clinical studies, phytates may be a potential natural source for health benefits. To improve clinical efficacy and human health benefits, further dose-response studies are needed to determine effective therapeutic doses and potential interactions with conventional drugs.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Phytates are nutrient-binding compounds found mainly in cereals and legumes, which may significantly contribute to micronutrient malnutrition in regions where phytate-rich cereals, such as maize, are staple food.
OBJECTIVES: This study investigated how maize fermentation, both alone and in combination with soaking and germination, can reduce phytate levels and enhance the estimated bioavailability of iron and zinc.
METHODS: We evaluated various fermentation methods, including spontaneous fermentation; fermentation with starter cultures, either Lactiplantibacillus plantarum 299v® (Lp299) or yogurt containing viable Lacticaseibacillus casei; and fermentation with Lp299 of soaked and germinated maize. The outcome variables included changes in pH and lactic acid content during fermentation, and measurements of phytate levels (spectrophotometry), minerals (Atomic absorption) and protein (protein analyzer) in maize samples before and after treatments.
RESULTS: Fermentation with Lp299 of soaked and germinated maize grains yielded a phytate reduction of up to 85.6\% decreasing from 9.58 ± 0.05 g·kg-1 in raw maize to 1.39 ± 0.09 g·kg-1 after processing. Fermentation of raw maize flour using Lp299 or yogurt resulted in a similar phytate reduction of 65.3\% (3.35 ± 0.26 g·kg-1) and 68.7\% (3.02 ± 0.01 g·kg-1) respectively. Spontaneous fermentation yielded a phytate reduction of 51.8\% (4.65 ± 0.40 g·kg-1). This reduction in phytate content enhanced the estimated bioavailability of iron and zinc, particularly in the soaking-germination-fermentation combination, where the Phytate:Zinc molar ratio (Phy:Zn) dropped from 40.76 to 7.77, representing 81\% reduction from the raw maize. The Phytate:Iron molar ratio (Phy:Fe) dropped from 41.42 to 6.24 indicating an 85\% reduction. Additionally, fermentation led to a significant increase (p = 0.001) in protein content in maize flour after fermentation, ranging from 7.3 to 10.3\% after the various fermentation treatments. There was not significant difference in the protein increase when compared the fermentation types.
CONCLUSION: Lactic acid fermentation of soaked and germinated maize grains, emerged as the most promising process to enhance the bioavailability of essential minerals. This approach could help alleviate mineral deficiencies in populations dependent on maize-based diets. The findings underscore the potential of fermentation to be applied at the household level, which may bring up an alternative for programs and policies focused on reducing micronutrient deficiencies and improving food security in developing regions.},

              Background
              Children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may benefit from probiotics and prebiotics, but the effects are unclear. To determine whether probiotics and prebiotics affect children with ADHD, a systematic review was conducted.
            
            
              Methods
              The present systematic review analyzed cohort studies and randomized controlled trials that examined whether prebiotics and probiotics are associated with ADHD. Seven randomized controlled trials and two cohort studies met our inclusion criteria.
            
            
              Results
              
                Research on
                Lactobacillus rhamnosus
                GG (LGG) probiotic supplementation showed that children with ADHD had better emotional, physical, social, and school functioning, and a higher health‐related quality of life compared to the placebo group. The studies also showed that Synbiotic 2000 reduces markers of intestinal and vascular inflammation in children with ADHD, in part through increasing SCFA levels.
              
            
            
              Conclusion
              The use of probiotics and prebiotics as adjuvants therapy in patients with ADHD is beneficial. Further studies with longer duration, including more participants and a variety of age groups, and using various evaluation techniques such as in vivo observation are required to examine the effects of prebiotics and probiotics on ADHD.},

              Context
              Lean body mass is essential for health, yet consensus regarding the effectiveness of protein interventions in increasing lean body mass is lacking.
            
            
              Objective
              The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the dose–response relationship of the effects of protein intake on lean body mass.
            
            
              Data Sources
              The PubMed and Ichushi-Web databases were searched electronically, and reference lists of the literature included here and in other meta-analyses were searched manually.
            
            
              Study Selection
              Randomized controlled trials evaluating the effects of protein intake on lean body mass were included.
            
            
              Data Extraction
              Two authors independently screened the abstracts; 5 reviewed the full texts.
            
            
              Results
              A total of 5402 study participants from 105 articles were included. In the multivariate spline model, the mean increase in lean body mass associated with an increase in protein intake of 0.1 g/kg of body weight per day was 0.39 kg (95\%CI, 0.36–0.41) and 0.12 kg (95\%CI, 0.11–0.14) below and above the total protein intake of 1.3 g/kg/d, respectively.
            
            
              Conclusions
              These findings suggest that slightly increasing current protein intake for several months by 0.1 g/kg/d in a dose-dependent manner over a range of doses from 0.5 to 3.5 g/kg/d may increase or maintain lean body mass.

              BACKGROUND
              Compromised autophagy, including impaired mitophagy and lysosomal function, plays pivotal roles in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Urolithin A (UA) is a gut microbial metabolite of ellagic acid that stimulates mitophagy. The effects of UA's long‐term treatment of AD and mechanisms of action are unknown.
            
            
              METHODS
              We addressed these questions in three mouse models of AD with behavioral, electrophysiological, biochemical, and bioinformatic approaches.
            
            
              RESULTS
              Long‐term UA treatment significantly improved learning, memory, and olfactory function in different AD transgenic mice. UA also reduced amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau pathologies and enhanced long‐term potentiation. UA induced mitophagy via increasing lysosomal functions. UA improved cellular lysosomal function and normalized lysosomal cathepsins, primarily cathepsin Z, to restore lysosomal function in AD, indicating the critical role of cathepsins in UA‐induced therapeutic effects on AD.
            
            
              CONCLUSIONS
              Our study highlights the importance of lysosomal dysfunction in AD etiology and points to the high translational potential of UA.

                    Long‐term urolithin A (UA) treatment improved learning, memory, and olfactory function in Alzheimer's disease (AD) mice.

We aimed to examine the association between MDA and A-ADHD.
METHOD: The study comprised 20 A-ADHD patients from Gaziantep University Sahinbey Research Hospital Psychiatry Clinic, diagnosed by 2 psychiatrists (H.A.S. and S.S.) according to the Turkish version of the adult ADD/ADHD DSM-IV-Based Diagnostic Screening and Rating Scale, and 21 healthy volunteers. Malondialdehyde levels were measured in plasma samples of both study groups.
RESULTS: The mean (standard deviation [SD]) MDA levels in patients (2.44 [0.84] nmol/mL) were significantly higher than those of control subjects (0.36 [0.20] nmol/mL) (t=11.013, df=39, p{\textless}0.01).

This paper reviews the evidence for protective effects of essential metals, vitamins, edible plants, phytochemicals, probiotics and other dietary supplements against Cd and Pb toxicity and describes the proposed possible mechanisms. Based on these findings, dietary strategies are recommended for people at risk of Cd and Pb exposure. The application of these strategies is advantageous for both the prevention and alleviation of Cd and Pb toxicity, as such supplements can be added easily and affordably to the daily diet and are expected to have very few side effects compared to the chelation therapy.},

Indeed, oxidative stress has been associated with many metabolic disorders due to unhealthy dietary patterns and may be alleviated by properly increasing the intake of antioxidants. Thus, it is quite important to adopt a healthy dietary mode to regulate oxidative stress and maintain cell and tissue homeostasis, preventing inflammation and chronic metabolic diseases. This review focuses on the links between dietary nutrients and health, summarizing the role of oxidative stress in ‘unhealthy’ metabolic pathway activities in individuals and how oxidative stress is further regulated by balanced diets.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Neurological disorders include a variety of conditions, including Alzheimer’s disease, motor neuron disease and Parkinson’s disease, affecting longevity and quality of life, and their pathogenesis is associated with oxidative stress. Several of the chronic neurodegenerative pathologies of the CNS share some common features, such as oxidative stress, inflammation, synapse dysfunctions, protein misfolding and defective autophagia. Neuroinflammation can involve the activation of mast cells, contributing to oxidative stress, in addition to other sources of reactive oxygen species. Antioxidants can powerfully neutralize reactive oxygen species and free radicals, decreasing oxidative damage. Antioxidant genes, like the manganese superoxide dismutase enzyme, can undergo epigenetic changes that reduce their expression, thus increasing oxidative stress in tissue. Alternatively, DNA can be altered by free radical damage. The epigenetic landscape of these genes can change antioxidant function and may result in neurodegenerative disease. This imbalance of free radical production and antioxidant function increases the reactive oxygen species that cause cell damage in neurons and is often observed as an age-related event. Increased antioxidant expression in mice is protective against reactive oxygen species in neurons as is the exogenous supplementation of antioxidants. Manganese superoxide dismutase requires manganese for its enzymic function. Antioxidant therapy is considered for age-related neurodegenerative diseases, and a new mimetic of a manganese superoxide dismutase, avasopasem manganese, is described and suggested as a putative treatment to reduce the oxidative stress that causes neurodegenerative disease. The aim of this narrative review is to explore the evidence that oxidative stress causes neurodegenerative damage and the role of antioxidant genes in inhibiting reactive oxygen species damage. Can the neuronal environment of oxidative stress, causing neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, be reduced or reversed?},

Although most studies to date have focused on the role of carnosine in metabolic and cardiovascular disorders, the physiological presence of this di-peptide and its analogues in the brain together with their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier as well as evidence from in vitro, animal, and human studies suggest carnosine as a promising therapeutic target in brain disorders.

Ferulic acid (FA), with certain antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, is widely used in many cosmetics, even used to treat various diseases in the clinic. In this study, the FA structural skeleton was used to search for FA derivatives. Then, molecular docking, the rule of five, and Veber rules were performed to virtually screen compounds that can bind to proteins with a good drug likeness. DPPH and ABTS were used to evaluate their antioxidant potency and an MTT assay was employed to investigate the toxicities of the compounds, while Griess Reaction System and ELISA were used to judge the concentration variations of NO and different inflammatory factors (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6). Western blotting featured nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) protein expression levels. The trend of the intracellular changes of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was detected by the DCFH-DA method and fluorescence staining. As a result, we found that the ferulic acid derivative S-52372 not only had certain scavenging effects on free radicals in biochemical experiments, but also prevented inflammation and oxidative stress in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells in the cellular environment; intracellular ROS and inflammatory mediators, including iNOS, COX-2, TNF-α, and IL-6, were also suppressed. In a computer prediction, S-52372 owned better water solubility and lower toxicity than FA. This compound deserves further research to find an ideal FA derivative.},

	abstract = {Tetrahydrobipterin (BH4) is a pivotal enzymatic cofactor required for the synthesis of
serotonin, dopamine and nitric oxide. BH4 is essential for numerous physiological processes at periphery
and central levels, such as vascularization, inflammation, glucose homeostasis, regulation
of oxidative stress and neurotransmission. BH4 de novo synthesis involves the sequential activation
of three enzymes, the major controlling point being GTP cyclohydrolase I (GCH1). Complementary
salvage and recycling pathways ensure that BH4 levels are tightly kept within a physiological
range in the body. Even if the way of transport of BH4 and its ability to enter the brain after peripheral
administration is still controversial, data showed increased levels in the brain after BH4
treatment. Available evidence shows that GCH1 expression and BH4 synthesis are stimulated by
immunological factors, notably pro-inflammatory cytokines. Once produced, BH4 can act as an anti-
inflammatory molecule and scavenger of free radicals protecting against oxidative stress. At the
same time, BH4 is prone to autoxidation, leading to the release of superoxide radicals contributing
to inflammatory processes, and to the production of BH2, an inactive form of BH4, reducing its
bioavailability. Alterations in BH4 levels have been documented in many pathological situations,
including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and depression, in which increased oxidative
stress, inflammation and alterations in monoaminergic function are described. This review aims at
providing an update of the knowledge about metabolism and the role of BH4 in brain function,
from preclinical to clinical studies, addressing some therapeutic implications.},

            People with severe mental illness have high rates of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Emerging evidence suggests that metabolic dysfunction may be causally linked to the risk of severe mental illness. However, more research is needed to identify reliable metabolic markers which may have an impact on mental health outcomes, and to determine the mechanisms behind their impact. In the METPSY research study, we will investigate the relationship between metabolic markers and clinical outcomes of severe mental illness in young adults. We will recruit 120 young adults aged 16–25 years living in Scotland with major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, or no severe mental illness (controls) for a prospective observational study. We will assess clinical symptoms at three in-person visits (baseline, 6 months, and 12 months) using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5, and collect blood samples at each of these visits for agnostic profiling of metabolic biomarkers through an untargeted metabolomic screen, using the rapid hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography ion mobility mass spectrometry method (RHIMMS). Participants will also complete remote assessments at 3 and 9 months after the baseline visit: Ecological Momentary Assessments to measure mental health, wrist actigraphy to measure rhythms of rest and activity, and continuous glucose monitoring to measure metabolic changes. Throughout the 12-month enrolment period, we will also measure objective markers of sleep using a radar sleep monitor (Somnofy). Using advanced statistical techniques and machine learning analysis, we will seek to better understand the mechanisms linking metabolic health with mental health in young adults with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and severe depression.

SUBJECTS: Individual data on 1114 people included in 12 trials.
FINDINGS: The proportional and absolute reductions in blood homocysteine produced by folic acid supplements were greater at higher pretreatment blood homocysteine concentrations (P {\textless} 0.001) and at lower pretreatment blood folate concentrations (P {\textless} 0.001). After standardisation to pretreatment blood concentrations of homocysteine of 12 mumol/l and of folate of 12 nmol/l (approximate average concentrations for Western populations), dietary folic acid reduced blood homocysteine concentrations by 25\% (95\% confidence interval 23\% to 28\%; P {\textless} 0.001), with similar effects in the range of 0.5-5 mg folic acid daily. Vitamin B-12 (mean 0.5 mg daily) produced an additional 7\% (3\% to 10\%) reduction in blood homocysteine. Vitamin B-6 (mean 16.5 mg daily) did not have a significant additional effect.
CONCLUSIONS: Typically in Western populations, daily supplementation with both 0.5-5 mg folic acid and about 0.5 mg vitamin B-12 would be expected to reduce blood homocysteine concentrations by about a quarter to a third (for example, from about 12 mumol/l to 8-9 mumol/l). Large scale randomised trials of such regimens in high risk populations are now needed to determine whether lowering blood homocysteine concentrations reduces the risk of vascular disease.},

This review aims to discuss the pharmacological effects of NOB with specific mechanisms of actions. NOB may become a promising candidate for potential drug development. However, further investigations of NOB on specific intracellular targets and clinical trials are still needed, especially for
