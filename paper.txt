For full guidelines please refer to Author Guidelines
ADHD, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, multiple sclerosis, and Alzheimer’s disease
may share overlapping biological dysfunctions, including chronic inflammation,
neurochemical imbalance, and mitochondrial impairment. Pharmacological
treatments can alleviate symptoms but rarely address these root causes and may
contribute to further dysregulation. Poor diet is another modifiable driver of these
interconnected pathways. Evidence shows that targeted dietary interventions,
particularly those incorporating polyphenols, omega-3 fatty acids, pre- and
probiotics, and key micronutrients, can improve ADHD symptoms, especially in
individuals who do not tolerate or respond to medication. This paper gives a
narrative review plus a conceptual synthesizes of the current research on ADHD-
related biological systems dysregulation and dietary support presenting the
scientific rationale for the B.R.A.I.N. Diet (Bio-Regulation Algorithm and Integrated

Overview of key dietary foundations
Neurodevelopmental disorders such as ADHD, ASD, and bipolar disorder, and neurodegenerative
conditions like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease, have complex, multifactorial origins. Although
the precise causes are not fully understood, these conditions share overlapping biological
dysfunctions, including mitochondrial impairment, chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, impaired
methylation, gut–brain axis disruption, glucose dysregulation, micronutrient deficiencies, and
neurotransmitter imbalances (Figure 1). These interconnected systems, while not sole causes of such
disorders, can contribute to symptom burden and overall metabolic and mental health.

Targeting these pathways through nutrition offers a low-risk approach with potential to improve
brain health and, in some cases, alleviate ADHD symptoms by optimising overall neurobiological
function. Dietary interventions have been shown to slow cognitive decline (Agarwal et al. 2023;
Katonova et al. 2022) and may help stem progression from neurodevelopmental to
neurodegenerative conditions ((Leffa et al. 2023; L. Zhang et al. 2022).
An extensive literature review found no existing long term dietary protocol, that is both low-risk and
comprehensive in applying a systems-based approach to improving brain health. Given the genetic
overlap, shared biological mechanisms, and correlated symptom profiles among neurodevelopmental
and neurodegenerative conditions, we propose that a targeted brain health diet may offer more
potential in reducing the wide-ranging and often debilitating symptoms that individuals with these
disorders experience. The focus of this paper is anchored in ADHD and brain health which supports
ADHD but also it is hypothesized that individuals experiencing other brain related conditions like
ASD, Bipolar, Alzheimer’s etc would benefit.
Researched dietary interventions for ADHD
The most widely trialled dietary strategies for ADHD, historically have been:
• Restricted Elimination Diets (RED)
• Artificial Food Colour Elimination (AFCE)
• Omega-3 / Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFA) supplementation
• Targeted vitamin–mineral combinations
There have been several diets that focused on ADHD these include: Restricted Elimination Diets
(RED) (Rommelse and Buitelaar 2013)(Rommelse and Buitelaar 2013), Artificial Food Color
Elimination (AFCE), Omega-3 fatty acids or Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFA) supplementation,
and also targeted vitamin and mineral combination studies. A meta-analyses(Stevenson et al. 2014)
(Stevenson et al. 2014) found the range of average effect sizes in standard deviation units as follows:
RED (0.29–1.2), AFCE (0.18–0.42) and PUFA (0.17–0.31).
The foundations of the Mediterranean diet ( high consumption of fruit, vegetables, legumes, olive oil,
and moderate consumption of fish and white meat), are an excellent basis for improving overall
health and these diets have shown some efficacy against a wide array of conditions like
ADHD(Aksoy and Doguer 2025) (Darabi et al. 2022), Alzheimers (Morris et al. 2015) (Ashley
Holub 2022), . Conversely studies have shown that an unhealthy western diet can trigger
ADHD(Horner et al. 2025) (Howard et al. 2011).
Other diets with potential for ADHD – Keto and Fast Mimicking
Given the rising rates of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, or at least the
identification of them, the need for evidence based nutritional interventions to support cognitive
function and mental health has never been more urgent. Recent dietary strategies such as the
Ketogenic diet (Galali et al. 2024) and the Fast Mimicking Diet(Rangan et al. 2022) have contributed
significantly to the field by demonstrating targeted metabolic and neurological benefits, while studies
are still limited, and with mixed results larger more tightly controlled studies are needed (Omori et al.
2024). However, concerns remain regarding the long-term safety and feasibility of such approaches,
for example the ketogenic diet, is associated with warnings against long term health concerns such as
cardiac risk, poor lipid profiles and possible glucose intolerance (Crosby et al. 2021; Popiolek-Kalisz
2024; Joo et al. 2023; W. Li et al. 2024). Consideration of inducing ketosis via plant fats may reduce

the health burden and prove equally effective(Fuehrlein et al. 2004).Meanwhile, the Fast Mimicking
Diet is intended to be implemented upon five day cycles with the expectation that normal dietary
habits resume after that period.
The B.R.A.I.N Diet Overview
The BRAIN Diet (Bio-Regulation Algorithm and Integrated Neuronutrition); for neuronutrition see
(Badaeva et al. 2023) is A Mediterranean-Rooted Precision Nutrition Model . It is a plant-based
leaning protocol i.e. (70% minimum energy minimum from plants). The research highlights
advantages and possible nutritional shortcomings of vegan diets and while trying to address as many
of these gaps as possible with natural food solutions, research shows that vegans commonly take
essential supplements.
While plants form the foundation with high polyphenol count targets and targeted herbs and spices,
the omnivore version of the diet also incorporates nutrient-dense animal foods such as seafood, eggs,
fermented dairy, occassional offal (Latoch et al. 2024) i.e. liver and lean animal proteins. There is a
gut microbiome focus via a wide array of gut supporting nutrients and other key brain supporting
nutrients such as omega 3, creatine, Coq10, etc.
The BRAIN Diet adheres to international nutritional intake guidelines while allowing
for personalisation based on other complementary individual goals besides brain health, such as
building muscle mass, gut healing, food sensitivities or intolerances, or aligning with ethical and
environmental values.
This is a food-first, no-supplement baseline approach designed to modulate key biological systems
commonly disrupted in ADHD, depression, cognitive decline, and other neurocognitive disorders.
Vegan participants may be more likely, as is currently the case to take supplements but the diet will
target the widest array of food types to match the nutrient breadth and targets of the omnivore
version, but all targets cannot be met from plants alone. While inspired by the Mediterranean diet’s
strengths in cardiometabolic health, the BRAIN Diet advances this model by incorporating:
• Targeted micronutrient density (e.g., magnesium, B6, choline, zinc, iron)
• Neurotransmitter precursor support (e.g., tyrosine, tryptophan, choline, DHA)
• Circadian-aligned meal timing, especially protein-rich breakfasts
• Food matrix strategies to improve nutrient synergy and bioavailability
• Psychobiotic and polyphenol-rich foods for gut-brain axis regulation
• Mitochondrial support and methylation pathway modulation
The Framework which supports the BRAIN diet is depicted below (Figure 2). This paper focuses
primarily on the research relating to the subjects under the “Food Matrix”, “Food Components”
“Biological Targets” and “Preparation Science”. However, the sourcing, the ethics and the mindful
eating strategies as represented in the framework are all essential elements that would contribute
towards treating food as a legitimate, medical-grade intervention.

Many of the biological mechanisms discussed below, such as gut microbiome composition, gut-brain
axis dynamics, and neurotransmitter regulation, are still emerging fields. They require further
exploration through larger, more nuanced human studies to strengthen their clinical relevance, but
some positive human studies exist and much preclinical research indicates dietary interventions could
be highly beneficial.
2. Food Matrix Interactions
The ‘food matrix’ is the integrated physical and chemical environment in which nutrients and
bioactives exist, influencing digestion, absorption, and biological effect This perspective moves
beyond reductionist nutrient counting to a systems-based view of whole foods, preparation methods,
and synergistic pairings. (Fardet and Rock 2015). It factors in the complex physical and chemical
environment in which nutrients and bioactives exist including knowledge of the interaction of foods,
particularly whole foods, as part of a meal, and those synergies and interactions which are introduced
when eating foods together.
The food matrix also factors in how the body processes those nutrients, including:
• Bioaccessibility (Auer et al. 2024)(Auer et al. 2024) (what’s released during digestion) ; will
depend on antinutrients, cell wall structure(Holland et al. 2020), preparation method i.e.
sprouting, soaking, manufacturing i.e. roasting, cleaving etc(Opazo-Navarrete et al. 2025)
(Opazo-Navarrete et al. 2025).
• Bioavailability (what’s actually absorbed into the bloodstream).

• Biotransformation by the gut microbiome i.e. studies have shown Urolithin A, a antioxidant
isn’t absorbed the same by everybody(Singh et al. 2022) (Singh et al. 2022) , those with
increased gut biota Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio were more succussful .
This body of knowledge also includes the science of food preparation and cooking, and the resulting
biologic interactions and metabolic outcomes. A milestone study by (Haber et al. 1977) demonstrated
how apple juice compared to apple puree or a ‘whole food’ and how the juice caused a much greater
insulin spike while also resulting in reduced satiety.
The State of Bioavailability Information
In nutritional therapy it is essential to maximise nutrient bioavailability through strategic food
combinations, particularly for individuals with ADHD, where micronutrient status often plays a role
in symptom modulation. While complete food matrix interactions and synergistic bioavailability
effects remain largely un-mapped (Melse-Boonstra 2020) existing literature provides key
foundational estimates from which real nutritional advantages can be gained (Gibson 2007). While
food labeling systems may not yet account for these variables, emerging nutritional science offers
enough insight to strategically design diets that harness matrix effects for improved metabolic and
cognitive outcomes.
The need to make knowledge open and accessible
A wealth of nutritional science lies in the publications of food scientists such as Harold McGee,
Heston Blumenthal, and Nathan Myhrvold and other pioneers who have brought deep biochemical
understanding to the culinary world. However the majority of food science principles remain locked
away in firewalled scientific journals, representing a hugely wasteful opportunity to improve public
health. However open-access nutritional and bio-chemistry journals do provide a rich source of
knowledge we highlight some key studies below.
Food Preparation in managing harmful and healthful byproducts
Knowledge driven preparation of food is essential in creating clinical grade meals where nutrients
are preserved, including antioxidants, and antinutrients are reduced (phytates, lectins, oxalates,
tannins) and harmful food byproducts i.e. those crated through excessive heat and oxidation.
Oxidation End Products
Oxidation end products are reactive compounds formed when fats, proteins, and carbohydrates
undergo heat- or oxidation-driven chemical changes during cooking and storage; their accumulation
can disrupt cellular function and has been linked to metabolic, cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative
disorders. There are also a set of antinutrients which can be stategically reduced via preparation
methods, we outline some of the key examples below.
One of the most well known, particulary by chefs, is the malliard reaction. This is the surface
browning seen on food when heated sugars oxidise with amino acids, it can be used as a visual
mechanic to steer food away from a damaging level of cooking. The malliard properties ( or
Maillard reaction products (MRPs) of some foods actually have antioxidant properties though this is
more common in carbohydrate high foods, breads etc, not so much in meats, unless sugar containing
marinades are used.

MRPs possess excellent antioxidant ability in many food products, through chelation of metal ions,
breakdown of radical chains and hydrogen peroxide, and scavenging of reactive oxygen
species(Nooshkam, Varidi, and Bashash 2019). There is a point which needs to be avoided through
precise cooking so antioxidants don’t break down and harmful byproducts don’t appear such as
acrylamide and HCAs and PAHs(Edna Hee et al. 2024).
Antinutrients
In the context of a diverse, well-prepared diet, antinutrients such as phytates, oxalates, lectins,
and tannins rarely pose a threat to nutrient status or cognitive health. In fact, many of these
compounds have dual roles, with emerging evidence pointing to health-protective properties such
as antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects.
Unless a person has specific risk factors (e.g. mineral deficiency, kidney stones, gut permeability),
there's little evidence that dietary antinutrients cause harm. While phytates can bind essential
minerals such as zinc, iron, and calcium, potentially impairing their absorption, they can also exhibit
antioxidant properties, and have been associated with reduced risk of kidney stones and some cancers
(Taylor et al. 2009).

3. Micronutrients and Nutrient-Dense Foods for Brain Health
Micronutrients not only drive enzymatic pathways directly, but also act as gatekeepers for other
dietary bioactives. Their availability can determine whether compounds such as omega-3 fatty acids,
polyphenols, or amino acid precursors exert their intended effects. This interdependence highlights
the importance of viewing nutrition as a network rather than in isolation.
Vitamins and minerals function as indispensable micronutrients and enzymatic cofactors
in pivotal brain biology pathways, aiding neurotransmitter synthesis, mitochondrial energy
production, DNA repair, antioxidant defense, methylation, and the regulation of neuroplasticity
(Tardy et al. 2020) with B-vitamins playing a central role (Kennedy 2016).
For a wide array of vitamins and minerals research suggests that increased adherence to the
Mediterranean diet is effective in targeting essential vitamins and minerals, due to the wide array of
fruits, vegtables, and healthy fats (Castro-Quezada, Román-Viñas, and Serra-Majem 2014).
Reccomended Daily Amounts and Revisions
There are many shifts in the considerations of the RDAs and recent research has highlighted
potential shortfalls in long considered optimal RDAs such as vitamin D , b6, and b12.. Many studies
have hypothesized that many vitamins can have more benefits when dosed well above RDAs and
more towards upper tolerable limits, particularly water soluble vitamins such as B vitamins (Kennedy
2016)(Kennedy 2016) which are not stored in the body in any significant amount with excesses being
quickly excreted through urine. The brain however has more careful longer term control over
nutrients so shortfalls are not experienced so frequently
Recent studies however have noted a lack of Pharmacokinetic data available to inform any real
dietary precision in interim daily dosing of vitamins (Sugandhi et al. 2024).
Water soluble vitamins B1 (thiamine), B2 (riboflavin), B3 (niacin), B5 (pantothenic acid), B6
(pyridoxine), B8 (biotin), B9 (folic acid), B12 (cobalamin), and vitamin C (ascorbic acid) must be
regularly included in the diet to prevent deficiency

Research indicates that deficiencies in vitamins and minerals essential for methylation, such as folate,
vitamin B12, and zinc, are correlated to ADHD symptoms and that supplementing these
micronutrients has shown potential in supporting methylation and reducing symptom severity
(Razavinia et al. 2024) . Other common deficiencies, particularly linked with children, are iodine and
iron (“WHO Micronutrient Deficiencies” 2025). A large Australian cohort study, discussed in the
review by (Millichap and Yee 2012)found that dietary patterns rich in fiber, folate, and omega-3 fatty
acids were associated with reduced ADHD symptoms.
Nutrient Density
As we've seen throughout this paper, the full power of nutrient-network effects depends on the
consistent availability of key dietary precursors and synergistic nutrients. Whether it’s supporting a
diverse gut microbiome, network polyphenol interactions, a broad spectrum of vitamins and
minerals, optimal amino acid profiles from plant and/or animal sources, or balanced omega-3 to
omega-6 ratios, all of these inter-related nutrients can only work when highly nutritional food targets
that provide these cofactors and precurors are regularly provided. While it’s not realistic to meet
every nutritional need every single day, nutrient-dense foods give us the best opportunity to build
meals that support these complex physiological demands, so that over time, most recommended daily
requirements are met.
This goes beyond a standard nutrient density focus, it's about choosing foods for their specific
bioactive potential: extra virgin olive oil with higher levels of CoQ10 and polyphenols, grass-fed
liver for bioavailable retinol and B12, mucuna beans for natural LDOPA(Gasmi et al. 2022),
traditionally fermented breads that optimize Maillard Reaction Products (MRPs) , or cooled grains ,
fish roe for phosphlypic bound omega 3 or algal oil for vegetarians etc . Even the water we drink,
ideally filtered and re-mineralized and occasional red wine, should be selected by its tannin and
antioxidant profile.
Cobalamin (B12): is crucial role in its involvement in the conversion of methylmalonyl-CoA to
succinyl-CoA , a key step in mitochondrial energy production. A deficiency in B12 can lead to a
buildup of methylmalonic acid and odd-chain fatty acids, which are neurotoxic and contribute to
myelin sheath damage. This disruption is linked to symptoms such as memory loss, brain fog,
depression, and even early signs of dementia, vitamin B12 deficiency may even lead to dementia and
psychosis, suggesting a broader dependence of the brain on B12, it is also commonly deficient in
vegetarians (Pawlak et al. 2013).
● Thiamine (B1): Critical for pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and mitochondrial α-KGDH,
thiamine supports aerobic metabolism. Deficiency leads to impaired pyruvate entry into the
TCA cycle, causing lactate buildup and metabolic dysfunction, which is associated with
cognitive impairments in ADHD.
○ Absorption Rate: About 50–90% from dietary sources; absorption can decrease if
consumed in very high doses or with alcohol, which can impair thiamine uptake.
○ RDA: 1.2 mg for men, 1.1 mg for women.

○ Supplement Note: Supplementation (50–100 mg) may support those with neurological
issues, chronic stress, or fatigue. High doses are sometimes used to support brain
health or in cases of thiamine deficiency.(Doshi et al, n.d.; Pawlak et al. 2013)
• B3 - Niacin (B3): Crucial for NAD+ and NADP+, niacin is involved in glycolysis and the TCA
cycle. Lack of niacin hampers NAD+ regeneration, decreasing ATP production and
potentially affecting cognitive performance (Pirinen et al. 2020).

● Pantothenic acid (B5): Essential for CoA and PDH function, which are necessary for TCA
cycle energy generation. Deficiency impairs fatty acid oxidation and ATP production,
potentially affecting brain energy levels (Liu et al., 2017).
○ Absorption Rate: 50–80% from dietary sources, mostly absorbed as CoA.
○ RDA: 5 mg for adults.
○ Supplement Note: Supplementation isn’t typically necessary but may be useful in
high-stress situations, as pantothenic acid supports adrenal function. Common
supplemental doses range from 100 to 1,000 mg.
● B6 ‘Pyridoxine’ active form P5P pyridoxal-5'-phosphate
○ In ADHD, genetic variations and enzymatic inefficiencies can influence metabolic
pathways critical for neurotransmitter synthesis, including the activation and
utilization of vitamin B6. Pyridoxine kinase (PDXK) is one such enzyme essential for
converting dietary vitamin B6 (in the forms of pyridoxine, pyridoxal, and
pyridoxamine) into pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (P5P), the bioactive form. Deficiencies or
inefficiencies in this conversion may impact key processes involved in ADHD
symptoms. B6 and magnesium are cofactors and doses of b6 and magnesium have
been found to reduce inattention and hyperactivity (M Mousain-Bosc 1 2006) .b6 is
not highly bioavailable in plant based diets and vegan populations can be deficient ,
particularly older individuals (Waldmann et al. 2006).
● Iron and Ferritin: The relation to iron and ADHD is complex and iron supplementation has
not proven effective in relieving ADHD symptons possibly because iron also catalyzes
reactions that increase oxidative stress. Iron has to be considered in it’s relationship with
Ferritin. Ferritin, an intracellular protein, stores iron and regulates its release, thereby limiting
the amount of free iron that can produce oxidative radicals . In ADHD patients, lower serum
ferritin levels were however found compared to controls. This implies a lower regulation of
iron, resulting in more free iron and thereby potentially creating more oxidative stress,
○ Iron Absorption Rate: Highly variable (14–18% from supplements).
○ RDA: 8 mg for men, 18 mg for women.
○ Supplement Need: Many iron supplements provide more than the RDA to
compensate for low absorption rates.
● Vitamin D: Vitamin D is crucial for brain development and cognitive function. It regulates
neurotrophic factors, which are vital for the survival and growth of neurons, and modulates
immune responses to reduce inflammation in the brain. It is highly prevalent for populations to
have high levels of vitamin D deficiency and this is particularly important for those
consuming vegetarian and vegan diets, where there is a low intake of animal-based
vitamin D. One study looked at the modelling in dietary guidelines with a view to
expediting the global acceptance of UV-exposed mushrooms as a source of vitamin
D.(Starck et al. 2024)Absorption Rate: Fat-soluble, best absorbed with food containing fat.

○ RDA: 600–800 IU.
○ Supplement Need: Many people take 1,000–2,000 IU to ensure adequate blood
levels, especially in low-sunlight environments.
• Magnesium supports neurtransmitter regulation, especially GABA (an inhibitory
neurtransmitter). Deficientcy is common in those with ADHD and can excerbate
symptons like irritability and attention difficulties. Supplementation with other
compounds such as vitamin D have shown to significantly reduce behavioural
problems be effective (Hemamy et al. 2020). Other studies have shown magnesium to
be effective with both zinc and omega 3 and 6 (Huss, Völp, and Stauss-Grabo 2010).
○ Magnesium is involved in over 300 enzymatic reactions, including:
■ modulating glutamate receptors
■ magnesium binds to ATP and all triphosphates in a cell to activate it
■ its as a cofactor in enzymes of glycolysis and the Krebs cycle ( the processes
that generate ATP from glucose )
■ it assists enzymes involved in the synthesis of dopamine and serotonin
■ it also helps manage stress responses.
■ Key mechanism in fighting pro-oxidants and supporting antioxidants(Zheltova
et al. 2016)
○ Absorption Rate: 30–40%.
○ RDA: 310–420 mg.
○ Supplement Need: Often taken in amounts close to or above the RDA (200–400 mg)
due to limited absorption from foods.
● Manganese Manganese is a cofactor for mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (SOD2) the
primary antioxidant enzyme within mitochondria. It is also linked to mild cognitive decline
and Alzhiermers. (Du et al. 2017).
○ Manganese absorption occurs in the small intestine, where it competes with calcium
, iron , magnesium, and zinc.
● Zinc: Zinc is important for DNA synthesis, cell division, and neurotransmitter regulation,
particularly in modulating dopamine—a key neurotransmitter implicated in ADHD.Higher
doses are sometimes recommended (e.g., 15–30 mg), especially in those with absorption
issues. Studies have shown benefits from higher doses of 30 mg in increasing BDNF(Agh et
al. 2022).
● Iodine is essential for the synthesis of thyroid hormones (T3 and T4), which are crucial for
brain development and maturation. Thyroid hormones influenced by iodine are involved in
the synthesis and regulation of key neurotransmitters like dopamine and serotonin
○ RDA 150 mcg/day
● CoQ10 -
The dietary algorithim needs to consider the storage and complementary and sometimes competing
mechanisms of all vitamins and minerals where available. Improved efficacy of spreading vitamins
through the day i.e. as b.i.d. dosing was found to be more effective for zinc glycinate(Arnold et al.
2011),(Akhondzadeh, Mohammadi, and Khademi 2004). To optimize those micronutrients critical to

health a balanced and broad diet is essential but also nutritionally rich foods which include high
levels of nutrients.
Closing the Vegan Nutrient Target Gaps
While the BRAIN Diet emphasizes food synergy and systems biology over isolated supplementation,
vegan versions of the protocol must still address key nutrient gaps that are difficult to close through
whole foods alone. These include vitamin B12, DHA/EPA, choline, taurine, carnosine, creatine, and
bioavailable iron and zinc, nutrients typically abundant in animal products. Precision sourcing of
functional plant-based ingredients such as Mankai duckweed (for B12 and iron), algal oil (for
DHA), fermented soy (for choline), and fortified nutritional yeast (for B12 and B6) allows for
meaningful progress. Inclusion of spirulina or chlorella, though limited by inactive analogues in the
case of B12, may still offer adjunctive benefit for amino acid profiles and antioxidant capacity. In
cases where whole-food intake cannot achieve therapeutic levels, strategic supplementation (e.g.,
methylcobalamin, creatine monohydrate, or liposomal iron) may be required to maintain
neurochemical and metabolic balance.
4. Protein & Amino Acid Sources –
‘Neuronutrition Core’
While micronutrients set the enzymatic processes driving brain health, it is the careful balance of the
macronutrients, protein, fats, and carbohydrates, that must work in harmony with our circadian
rhythms. Together, they regulate the key biological systems that shape everything from brain energy
and inflammation to cognition and mood.
Protein, one of the three primary macronutrients alongside fats and carbohydrates, is perhaps the
most debated area of nutrition. Its nuances span quality, source, frequency, digestibility, and
recommended intakes, all of which vary depending on the goal, be it longevity, muscle retention,
metabolic health, or, in the case of this paper, brain health.
The BRAIN Diet must account for these variables while ensuring that nutrition meets brain-specific
nutrient targets. This includes recognising that several brain-relevant nutrients are predominantly or
exclusively found in animal-sourced proteins—such as creatine, taurine, Coenzyme Q10 (also in
smaller amounts in olive oil; (Zmitek, Rodríguez-Aguilera, and Pravst 2014)), and vitamin B₁₂ (also
present in Wolffia globosa; (Kaplan et al. 2019)). Achieving the right balance between plant and
animal proteins is therefore essential, both for nutritional adequacy and for ensuring the diet remains
sustainable, inclusive, and neurologically effective over the long term.
Protein requirements are context-dependent: age, activity level, health goals, and personal values all
influence optimal intake. While general recommendations sit at around 0.83 g/kg/day (“Scientific
Opinion on Dietary Reference Values for Protein,” 2012), a meta-analysis (Morton et al., 2018)
showed that intakes up to 1.62 g/kg/day can maximise gains in fat-free mass during resistance
training, with no additional benefit beyond that point. More recent work ((Trommelen et al. 2023) )

indicates that protein consumed in larger boluses can maintain positive whole-body protein balance
over several hours, suggesting some flexibility in distribution.
Achieving the right balance between plant and animal protein sources is essential not only for
nutritional adequacy, but also for ensuring that the BRAIN Diet remains sustainable, inclusive, and
neurologically effective over the long term.
Balancing animal and plants for brain health
While observational studies frequently link vegetarianism with reduced chronic disease risk, the
relationship between diet type and brain health is more nuanced. Significant research gaps remain,
but existing research indicates truly optimal brain-focused nutrition may require a more strategic
approach that combines plant-based diversity with targeted animal-derived nutrients.
A recent Taiwanese cohort (J.-H. Tsai et al. 2022)) of 5,710 adults found that vegetarians had a 33%
lower risk of dementia compared to non-vegetarians. Similarly, Mediterranean dietary patterns have
shown neuroprotective effects, reducing dementia risk between 22–33% ((Shannon et al. 2023)),
even after correcting for genetic risk. Epidemiological data do not indicate that excluding all animal
foods is necessary for longevity, but rather that plant-forward diets, such as the Mediterranean, often
include modest amounts of dairy, fish, and meat, which are common denominators in Blue Zones
(Buettner and Skemp 2016).
Conversely, several studies highlight nutrient shortfalls in fully plant-based diets that may undermine
cognitive resilience. (Katonova et al. 2022)) note that while vegan diets are low in saturated fats and
cholesterol and rich in antioxidants and fiber, they can lack vitamin B12, vitamin D, DHA, and
certain minerals, all of which are critical for brain health. Supporting this concern, (Jigeer et al.
2025)) found that vegetarians in their 80s had higher odds of cognitive impairment compared to
omnivores, likely due to deficiencies in B12, EPA/DHA, and zinc.
Evidence also suggests that some degree of seafood intake may be necessary for optimal cognitive
outcomes. In a two-year follow-up of Dutch older adults, (van Soest et al. 2023) found that adherence
to a healthful plant-based diet did not improve cognition or slow decline unless participants
consumed at least one weekly portion of fish. This aligns with MIND diet research, where high
polyphenol intake (leafy greens, berries) combined with key animal-derived nutrients produced
measurable neuroprotective effects (. (van den Brink et al. 2019; Agarwal et al. 2023).).
The BRAIN Diet is designed to capture these dual benefits, leveraging abundant plant foods for
antioxidants, polyphenols, and fiber, while strategically including animal-derived sources of CoQ10,
creatine, taurine, and omega-3 fatty acids. For omnivores, this means leaning toward a predominantly
plant-based pattern with purposeful selection of animal proteins. For plant-based eaters, it involves
optimising brain health through a wide variety of nutrient-dense foods and supplementing where
dietary gaps are hard to fill.
Table X (below) compares the contribution of key brain-health nutrients which are normally
predominantly available from animal sources, highlighting why the BRAIN Diet incorporates both
plant-forward diversity and targeted inclusion of animal proteins or equivalent supplementation.

Table X - key brain-health nutrients which are normally predominantly available from animal sources
Animal and Plant Based Protein Balance examples
While most animal proteins provide all nine essential amino acids in optimal ratios, plant proteins
require strategic pairing. (Mariotti and Gardner 2019)(figure 1.1 below) Many plants are often low in
methionine and lysine so combinations such as grains or pseudograins with legumes can be essential
for vegetarians. When key brain health dietary targets cannot be met through whole foods alone, the
nutritional gaps could be made via appropriate supplementation. This is especially relevant for
individuals following vegetarian diets, where key brain nutrients (table X above) are often found in
lower amounts or are absent altogether.
Neurochemical Overview
Neurochemicals are molecules that are responsible for communication between nerve cells, and nerve
cells and other cells. They are typically classified based on their function which can be excitatory,
inhibitory or modulatory in nature, although some neurochemicals can have multiple functions.
Neurotransmitters can also be classified chemically as either amino acids, monoamines, purines, etc.
Neurotransmitter imbalances and Dopamine’s wider implications
Many neurological disorders are thought to be due to neurochemical imbalances although conclusive
proof is often lacking. (Akyuz et al. 2025) and much research has now implicated much broader
neurotransmitter dysregulation. A meta study analysis (MacDonald et al. 2024) concluded that while
dopaminergic dysfunction is consistently linked to ADHD, evidence does not support a simple global
hypo-dopaminergic model and that dopamine alterations vary by ADHD subtypes, developmental
stage, and brain region, interacting with other neurotransmitter systems. (Perreault et al. 2014) noted
the difficulties in really ‘disentangling’ pure dopaminergic neurotransmission from other transmitter
systems; >200 chemical messengers (classical transmitters, neuropeptides, purines, lipid mediators,
gases) have been described, underscoring the system’s complexity(Gasmi et al. 2022). This is why
the BRAIN Diet must target broad neurochemical precursors and cofactors to support efficient
neurotransmitter production.
Many neurological disorders are associated with neurochemical imbalances, although direct causal
proof is often limited (Akyuz et al., 2025). Increasingly, evidence points toward broader
neurotransmitter dysregulation rather than single-system deficits. A meta-analysis by MacDonald et
al. (2024) concluded that while dopaminergic dysfunction is consistently linked to ADHD, the data
do not support a simple global hypo-dopaminergic model. Instead, dopamine alterations vary by
ADHD subtype, developmental stage, and brain region, and frequently interact with other
neurotransmitter systems. As Perreault et al. (2014) note, disentangling “pure” dopaminergic
signalling from the influence of other transmitters remains a significant challenge.

For these reasons, the diet must target a broad spectrum of neurochemical precursors, while also
integrating anti-inflammatory nutrients and gut–brain modulators i.e. to support balanced
neurotransmitter production across systems—not dopamine alone. This approach aligns with dietary
intervention research showing that nutrient patterns rich in amino acid precursors, omega-3 fatty
acids, and polyphenols can influence dopamine, serotonin, GABA, and acetylcholine pathways
simultaneously, supporting mood stability, attention, and cognitive performance.
Default Mode Network (DMN).
Dopamine affects ADHD both as a crucial neurotransmitter involved in regulating attention, and
executive functions and also as a neuromodulator affecting broader neural networks such as the
Default Mode Network (DMN). The DMN are regions of the brain that are active during non-focused
activity such as daydreaming. The inability to move from a DMN state to an executive state has been
hypothesized as one of the causes of ADHD. Dopamine dysregulation in ADHD impairs the brain’s
ability to shift from rest-state (DMN) to focus-state networks. The BRAIN Diet uses nutrient-timed
meals to support this transition through dopamine precursors and anti-inflammatory nutrients to
reduce DMN dysregulation(Marsland et al. 2017). A meta-analysis has also shown that
amphetamine based medications consistently (11 of 12 studies) restored connectivity in DMN
areas(Santos et al. 2019).
Individuals targeting dopamine via fatty and sugary foods is common in ADHD populations which is
probably correlated to the double dopamine reward(Thanarajah et al. 2019) experienced when eating
food. These orosensory and post-ingestion dopamine circuits and reward systems can be utilised as
dietary strategies (Table 3 below)., they must be used sparingly as we discuss below eating is the
best strategy when the body needs nutrition, at other times other interventions are available such as
exercise or meditation.

Table 3. – Dopamine reward dietary strategies
Glutamate is the principal excitatory neurotransmitter of the central nervous system and the most
abundant neurotransmitter in the brain. It has wide clinical relevance in neurology and psychiatry,
and other cognitive function and mood deficits. (Zhou and Danbolt 2014). specifically regarding depression, substance use disorder, schizophrenia, neurodegenerative diseases,
Low levels of glutamate
in a number of critical brain areas correlated with low scores on the Barkley attention scale.
.Maltezos et al. 2014) ￼We discuss below how dietary phytochemicals such as genistein and omega-
3s, may help restore neurochemical homeostasis including dopamine and glutamate .
Norepinephrine, also known as noradrenaline, plays a significant role in attention, arousal, and the
modulation of executive functions. Alterations in norepinephrine signaling have been associated with
ADHD (O’Donnell et al. 2012), affecting the regulation of attention and response inhibition. The
physiological changes induced by the binding of norepinephrine to its receptors involve the
modulation of several cognitive and executive processes usually impaired in ADHD, supporting the
monoaminergic hypothesis for ADHD pathophysiology.
Serotonin is involved in mood regulation, emotional processing, and impulse control. Reduced
levels of serotonin may contribute to the development of ADHD, influencing hyperactive and
impulsive components of ADHD but perhaps not inattention (Banerjee and Nandagopal 2015). The
involvement of serotonin in ADHD is supported by findings that reduced levels of the
neurotransmitter may contribute to the disorder along with several genetic markers(Oades 2010).
Identifying neurotransmitter interplay with ADHD is confounded by the many comorbidities of
ADHD where more than 80 percent may exhibit co-morbid psychiatric problems and over half
express symptoms satisfying two or more co-morbid disorders (Cumyn, French, and Hechtman
2009).
Emotional Dysregulation and ADHD
Emotional dysregulation is also a major factor of ADHD with a growing body of research
recognizing emotional dysregulation as a core but underacknowledged component of the
condition, estimates suggest that 25–45% of children and 30–70% of adults have this
commobidity (Shaw et al. 2014) .
Oxytocin levels have also been implicated in ADHD study subjects correlating to clinically
significant emotional dysregulation, including, aggression, and impaired empathy(Hwang et
al. 2024).
Below we summarise the key neurotransmitters implicated in cognition, mood and ADHD
symptoms and their key precursors and cofactors.

Table X – Summary of ADHD implicated Neurochemicals
Key Neurotransmitter Strategies
Tryptophan, a serotonin precursor, has been linked to reduced anxiety, improved mood, and lower
depressive symptoms (Aquili, 2020a), but shows very limited benefit for ADHD symptoms (Dinu et
al., 2023). Its entry into the brain occurs via the LAT1 transporter and competes with other large
neutral amino acids (LNAAs) (tyrosine, phenylalanine, leucine, isoleucine, valine).
Carbohydrate-rich, low-protein meals raise the plasma tryptophan:LNAA ratio, because insulin
pushes the competing LNAAs out to muscles, lowering competing LNAAs in plasma, thereby
reducing competition at the BBB In a crossover breakfast study (Wurtman et al. 2003) (Wurtman et
al. 2003):
 Compared to the high protein breakfast, the high carbohydrate low protein breakfast raised the
tryptophan:LNAA ratio by a median ~54% (range ~36–88%).
 Compared to the high carbohydrate breakfast, the high protein breakfast raised the tyrosine:LNAA
ratio by a median ~28%(range ~10–64%).
(
Carbohydrate type also matters: sucrose produced a larger rise in tryptophan:LNAA (+34%)
than starch (+20%), consistent with higher-GI carbohydrates more strongly enhancing brain
tryptophan bioavailability (Lyons and Truswell 1988)(Lyons and Truswell 1988)).

Figure 3 –Figure 3 – Increasing Tyr + Trp over LAT1 with Carb loading
Tyrosine may enhance working memory performance in healthy older adults, potentially through
modulating functional connectivity in brain regions associated with cognitive control (Hensel et al.
2019)..Meta analysis of L-tyrosine have shown efficacy in some studies; other small studies
suggested a quick tolerance after limited efficacy of only 2 weeks (F W Reimherr and M Ward 1987)
suggesting that extra tyrosine will not fix a dopamine dysregulation problem and moreover that
dopamine dysregulation is not the only ADHD problem.
BDNF - Low levels of BDNF have been associated with various neurodevelopmental disorders,
including the polymorphism Val66me which has been linked with lower dopamine and lower BDNF
and correlated to anxiety and depression (Hünnerkopf et al. 2007). Knowing one’s Val66Met status,
via genetic testing, can inform personalized plans for exercise, dietary factors i.e. omega-3s which
also can increase BDNF (Ziaei et al. 2024).
Cholinergic systems
Choline, while not an amino-acid , is commonly found in protein-rich foods and plays a crucial role
in acetylcholine synthesis and membrane integrity in neurons. Choline has had a positive effect on
ADHD in studies (Derbyshire and Maes 2023). There are recent studies now targeting imbalances in
the cholinergic systems representing a new focus in ADHD etiology(Johansson et al. 2013).

GABAergic (γ-aminobutyric acid)– system
(GABA), the most abundant inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (CNS). While
the GABAergic system has not traditionally been implicated as a main cause of ADHD, many studies
have proven ADHD subjects have reduced GABA concentration compared with control subjects
(Edden et al. 2012) suggest impaired inhibitory tone and potential sleep disruption, contributing
towards hyperactivity (Puts et al. 2020) .
Circuit-level dysregulation of GABA, particularly involving excitation–inhibition (E/I) imbalance,
has been been linked to neurotransmitter crosstalk, showing the pleiotropic nature of
neuroransmitters. For example how the excitatory glutamate transmitter binds to the inhibitory
GABAA receptor, thereby allosterically potentiating its inhibitory function. (A. Chai 2025) .
(Mamiya et al. 2021) propose E/I balance as a candidate biomarker for ADHD, stating the
development of GABA modulating interventions as high potential candidates.
Supporting GABA synthesis, signaling, and receptor modulation through dietary inputs may provide
a novel, underexplored avenue for intervention. Key contributors include:
• Vitamin B6 – cofactor for glutamate decarboxylase, essential for converting glutamate to
GABA.
• Magnesium – functions as an NMDA receptor antagonist and GABA receptor modulator
((Clerc et al. 2013))).
• Zinc – acts as an allosteric modulator of the GABA receptor ((Peralta and Huidobro-Toro
2016));).
• Functional amino acids – taurine, glycine, and theanine enhance inhibitory signaling.
• Fermented foods – provide exogenous GABA and microbiota-mediated GABA precursors.
• Polyphenols – compounds such as genistein have been directly linked to GABA modulation.
Implications for Dietary Strategy
GABA is one example how the broad food matrix support for neurotransmitters is key in creating
overall neurotransmitter production balance and potentially bringing better E/I balance to improve
ADHD symptoms. Targeting regular dietary neurotransmitter precursors and cofactors should have a
positive effect on cognition and ADHD symptoms such as attention and hyperactivity.
Looking beyond dietary strategies for neurochemical support
Although not traditionally considered a target in ADHD treatment, oxytocin has been linked also to
reducing impulsivity in ADHD while studies have also found dopamine levels involved in ADHD
etiology impair oxytocin levels in children with ADHD(Esra DEMİRCİ 1 2016) . The modulation of
oxytocin through diet, lifestyle, and social connection represents a promising avenue for holistic
lifestyle and dietary support. The BRAIN Diet promotes endogenous oxytocin production through
lifestyle strategies like mindful meals and shared eating, fermented foods that support the gut and

5. Fats: Omega-3 & Brain-Healthy Fats
The Role of Fats in Brain Function
Fats, or dietary lipids, are a fundamental pillar of brain health, influencing everything from
membrane composition to inflammatory tone and neurotransmitter regulation. This section looks at
omega-3 specifically but below we also cover fats which help minimise oxidation in cooking or fats
that introduce antioxidants and other nutrient rich substances like CoQ10 in extra virgin olive oil.
Many other fats offer great nutritional value are commonly overlooked such as duck fat, MCT oil,
and certain nuts, and avocado (see table 4 below).
Cardiovascular Guidelines and Relevance to Brain Health
Dietary guidelines from the World Health Organization and the Dietary Reference Intakes
recommend a total fat intake between 20 and 35% of total calories(A. G. Liu et al. 2017) , with the
NHS stating 30g limit of saturated fats per day for males and 20g for women and not more than 5g of
transfats per day. (NHS.gov 2023). A 30 year longitudinal study (Yanping Li et al. 2015) found that
replacing 5% of energy intake from saturated fats with equivalent calories from PUFAs,
monounsaturated fats, or whole grain carbohydrates was associated with a 25%, 15%, and 9% lower
risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), respectively.
Further guidance and clinical guideline averages of daily values:
• Monounsaturated fats (MUFA) — ~10–15%
Sources: extra-virgin olive oil, avocado, olives, nuts.
• Omega-3 (PUFA) — ~1–2% and 250–500 mg EPA+DHA/day (RCT variations: 500–2000
mg/day)
• Saturated fat (SFA) — <10% (ideally <7%)
Note: some short-/medium-chain SFAs may have niche metabolic roles. Sources: dairy fat,
meat, coconut.
• Trans fats — 0%
Eliminate industrial trans fats; avoid “partially hydrogenated oils” on labels.
The bidirectional link between heart health and brain health is well documented. Poor cardiovascular
function is associated with impaired stress responses, reduced cognitive performance, and increased
risk of Alzheimer’s disease. ADHD itself has been correlated with higher CHD risk (L. Li et al.
2022), though meta-analyses highlight the need for better-controlled studies due to key confounding
factors not being controlled such as exercise and diet . However, when designing a diet targeting
brain health, cardiovascular protection remains a critical co-priority.

Reframing Saturated Fat: miconutrient specifics
The BRAIN Diet prioritizes fats that reduce inflammation, support membrane integrity, and optimize
cognitive performance, rather than enforcing blanket restrictions on all sources of saturated fat or
cholesterol. While excessive intake is linked to cardiovascular risk, both nutrients serve critical
physiological roles, with cholesterol being essential for synapse formation, myelin integrity, and the
production of steroid-based neurohormones (Pfrieger 2003).
Instead of excluding them, dietary strategies should focus on unprocessed, nutrient-dense sources
such as Parmesan cheese, grass-fed butter, and pasture-raised egg yolks. When consumed in
moderation within an anti-inflammatory, micronutrient-rich diet, these foods can provide essential
brain nutrients including choline, vitamin K2, butyrate, and fat-soluble vitamins A, D, and E. Beyond
just the wide array and vitamins and minerals there are a wide array of powerful and proven nutrients
which are still underresearched but have great potentional(Table 4.) i.e. C15:0 (Parmesan and
grassfed Butter), asataxanthin (Fish roes), moreover as we consider the wider implications of the
food matrix, studies have shown that hard cheeses with high calcium do not raise serum LDL
levels(Soerensen et al. 2014).

3.1 Omega 3 Mechanisms of Action and success factors
LClick or tap here to enter text.ipids constitute 50–60% of dry weight of mature human brain with
35% of these comprising of PUFA with long chain (LC-PUFA) PUFA n-6 content reaching 17%
(mainly Arachidonic Acid) and the content of PUFA n-3 DHA was as much as 14%, depending upon
the brain region (McNamara and Carlson 2006).
Omega-3 fatty acids, particularly EPA and DHA, exert multifaceted effects on brain function that
extend beyond their structural roles in neuronal membranes. Their actions influence gene expression,
neurotransmission, inflammation resolution, and synaptic plasticity through a network of interrelated
pathways. . These include modulation of nuclear receptor signaling through PPAR proteins, support
for phospholipid membrane dynamics, and the generation of specialized proresolving mediators
(SPMs) that downregulate inflammatory responses.

Success Factors
Balance DHA/EPA and Omega-3/Omega-6 Balance
The balance between omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids plays a key role in regulating inflammation..
While arachidonic acid (AA), an omega-6 PUFA, gives rise to mostly pro-inflammatory eicosanoids,
omega-3s like eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and DHA are precursors to anti-inflammatory SPMs such
as resolvins, marensins and protectins. Western diets can skew this ratio as high as 20:1 in favor of
omega-6s, contributing to chronic inflammation and neurotransmitter dysregulation (Simopoulos
2011) while also increasing blood viscosity, vasospasm, and vasoconstriction which may play a
major role in inducing autoimmune, cardiovascular and neurological diseases. (Simopoulos 2009).
Most research showing brain function improvements lean towards higher ratio of EPA to DHA (e.g.,
2:1 ratio or higher though Stonehouse et al used a DHA dominant dose) with DHA having a more
structural role in the brain and EPA witha more functional role. (McNamara and Carlson 2006)One
meta study(Pei-Chen Chang 2021)(Stonehouse et al. 2013). Phospholipid Transport and DHA/EPA
Delivery across the Blood Brain Barrier.
Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is a key carrier of DHA and EPA to the brain. DHA or EPA incorporated
into PC and converted into lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC).which crosses the blood-brain barrier
(BBB) far more efficiently than its free fatty acid or triglyceride-bound forms (Patrick 2019) .

Studies show phospholipid-bound omega-3s such as krill oil and fish roe, provide EPA/DHA in a
phospholipid form that gets converted to LPC.s, (L. Liu et al. 2014) . Krill oil is also a favored food
source of DHA and EPA since it is low in the food chain, does not concentrate environmental toxins
or heavy metals (Colletti et al. 2021)(Patted et al. 2024)
Mechanisms of Action of omega-3
Specialized Pro-Resolving Mediators and Inflammation Resolution
Specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs), derived from omega-3s, play an active role in
terminating inflammation without suppressing immune surveillance. These include resolvins,
protectins, and maresins, which exert effects such as inhibition of neutrophil infiltration,
downregulation of COX-2, and enhancement of macrophage-mediated clearance of cellular debris
(Serhan and Petasis 2011). Moreover, SPMs modulate endothelial function through nitric oxide
release and support neuroprotection by limiting glutamate-induced excitotoxicity and promoting
regulatory T-cell differentiation (Briones et al. 2025). Although inflammation typically isolates
tissues that have been injured or infected and begins the repair of an injury it is important to resolve
and end the inflammatory response. SPMs are lipids that accomplish this without generalized
immunosuppression.
Membrane Phospholipids, Ion Channels, and Gamma Activity
Omega-3s such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and structural fats like linoleic acid contribute to
neuronal membrane fluidity, neurogenesis and neuroplasticity (Crupi, Marino, and Cuzzocrea 2013).
Phospholipid methylation (PLM), a process enhanced by dopamine D4 receptor activity, a key gene
implicated in ADHD (Martel et al. 2011), alters the structure of membranes, facilitating faster
neuronal recovery while influencing ion channel behavior in the generation of gamma oscillations,
brainwaves linked to attention and cognition. Abnormalities in membrane composition and PLM
have been linked to impaired ion channel regulation and reduced gamma-band activity in ADHD
((Cocchi et al. 2017) (Wilson et al. 2012)). Phospholipid methylation, dependent on SAMe, directly
affects membrane fluidity and neurotransmitter receptor function. Maintaining optimal intake of
phospholipid precursors, choline, methionine, and serine, may support PLM and cognitive
performance.
Endocannabinoid System Dysregulation & N-Acyl Lipid Signaling
The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is a key neuromodulatory system that helps regulate dopamine
signaling(Covey et al. 2017) and motivation(Laksmidewi and Soejitno 2021), stress response, and
inflammation, processes that are often disrupted in ADHD and other neurodevelopmental conditions.
A major pathway supporting this system is the CDP-ethanolamine pathway, which produces
phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)—a key brain phospholipid and poential ADHD biomarker. PE can be
converted into phosphatidylcholine (PC) or N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamines (NAPEs)(Garani,
Watts, and Mizrahi 2021). These NAPEs are precursors to N-acyl ethanolamines (NAEs) like
palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), oleoylethanolamide (OEA), and anandamide (AEA), bioactive lipids
which act as neuromodulators with anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, and mood-regulating effects.

High plasma levels of AEA have been correlated to psychotic disorders and lower levels to Major
Depressive Disorder(Garani, Watts, and Mizrahi 2021) while higher levels have also been associated
with ADHD (Brunkhorst-Kanaan et al. 2021).
Supporting NAPEs production through diet via PE-rich foods like eggs, fish roe, and liver may
enhance ECS tone. Clinical trials have shown a doubling of plasma levels after dietary increases in
oat bran due to it’s rich PE content (Sean Davies 2018). Polyphenols such as genistein may further
enhance ECS tone by inhibiting fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), the enzyme responsible for
AEA degradation (Gibellini and Smith 2010).
Additionally, polyphenols such as genistein may help preserve AEA levels by inhibiting fatty acid
amide hydrolase FAAH, the enzyme that breaks down AEA (Gibellini and Smith 2010). So by
preserving anandamide, Genistein may amplify the ECS's ability to regulate dopamine(Bare, Ghetti,
and Richter 1995), glutamate, and GABA signaling (Huang, Fang, and Dillon 1999) all key pathways
to regulate in ADHD.
Although omega-3s are not direct endocannabinoids, they contribute to endocannabinoid-like
signaling through the production of docosahexaenoyl ethanolamide (DHEA) , EPEA(Watson, Kim, and
Das 2019), and other N-acyl ethanolamines, and can indirectly affect ECS system. While more
research on the endocannabinoid pathways and ADHD is needed, its interactions with dopamine,
mood regulation, and inflammation make it a relevant secondary target, particularly in cases of
emotional dysregulation or stress sensitivity.
Considerations and Safety of Omega-3 Supplementation
Finally, although omega-3 supplementation is generally safe, a meta-analysis has reported a modestly
increased risk of atrial fibrillation in individuals with predisposing cardiovascular conditions
receiving high-dose omega-3 supplements, indicating the need for individual risk stratification ( f et
al. 2021).
3.2 Homocysteine, Methylation, and Cognitive Function
Methylation processes are central to neurotransmitter synthesis, membrane remodeling,
detoxification, and epigenetic regulation, all of which are relevant in the context of ADHD and
cognititon. B vitamins, particularly B6, folate (5-MTHF), and B12, are essential cofactors in the
remethylation of homocysteine (Hcy) to methionine, which is subsequently converted to S-
adenosylmethionine (SAMe), the universal methyl donor. One study with 3 groups taking
supplementations of 1: vitamin B-12, 2: fish oil, and 3:vitamin B-12+fish oil, lowered plasma Hcy
concentrations by 22%, 19%, and 39%, respectively (Tao Huang, n.d.). The VITACOG trial further
demonstrated that B vitamin supplementation slowed cognitive decline only in participants with
adequate omega-3 status (Oulhaj et al. 2016)

Elevated plasma homocysteine a byproduct of methylation, is elevated in ADHD and other
neurodegenerative diseases (Yu et al. 2020), (Luzzi et al. 2022), cognitive impairment, and
psychiatric conditions (Lukovac et al. 2024a). Hcy is implicated in the induction of oxidative stress,
the modulation of oxygen levels, and the initiation of lipid peroxidation pathway(Lukovac et al.
2024b).
Trimethylglycine (TMG), also known as betaine, is a dietary methyl donor that helps recycle Hcy to
methionine via an alternative pathway. Choline, a precursor to both TMG and phosphatidylcholine
(PC), is similarly involved in homocysteine clearance and, as discssued above, membrane
phospholipid biosynthesis. These pathways are vulnerable to genetic variants such as MTHFR
polymorphisms, which reduce the efficiency of folate cycling and methylation, thereby increasing
susceptibility to cognitive dysfunction and ADHD-related symptoms.
6. Carbohydrates , Fibre-Rich Foods for Gut Health
Brain Fuel and Complex Carbs for a Healthy Gut Biome
Carbohydrate selection is critical to regulating core biological processes relevant to brain function.
Poor carbohydrate choices may contribute to insulin dysregulation, inflammation, obesity, and other
metabolic disorders (Cho and Choi 2021) Because the brain has limited capacity to store energy,
maintaining a steady supply of glucose is essential for optimal cognitive function, unless a ketogenic
dietary pattern is being followed , and risks have to be carefully assessed.(Crosby et al. 2021)
Resistant Starches
The inclusion of complex carbohydrates and fermentable fibers plays a central role in supporting
metabolic health and brain function. Complex carbohydrates consist of long chains of sugar
molecules—such as starch and fiber, that digest more slowly, providing a steady release of glucose.
Key sources include whole grains (like puesdo grains like quinoa and buckwheat, grains like barley
and oats), fibrous vegetables, and legumes such as lentils and chickpeas. In parallel, both soluble
fiber (from apples, oats, flaxseeds) and insoluble fiber (from vegetables, nuts, and whole grains)
support digestive health, glycemic control, and microbial diversity, factors increasingly linked to
improved cognition, emotional regulation, and long-term neuroprotection (Massimino et al. 1998).
The complex carbohydrate, Resistant Starch, forms when certain starchy foods are cooked and then
cooled, a process called retrogradation. Foods like rice and potatoes develop higher resistant starch
content when chilled, and reheating does not reverse this effect one example i.e. white rice was
cooled and reheated showing a rise in RS content from 0.64 to 1.65 g/100 g and elicited a lower
glycemic response(Yunting Li et al. 2024).
These indigestible starches are fermented by gut bacteria in the colon, producing short-chain fatty
acids (SCFAs) such as butyrate, which help maintain gut barrier integrity, reduce systemic
inflammation, and influence brain function through immune, endocrine, and vagal pathways(Zhou et
al. 2015).

5.1 Possibilities and Challenges with Gut microbiome science
A growing body of evidence suggests that modulating the gut microbiome can positively influence
brain health and overall health. The gut is central in producing neurotransmitters, reducing systemic
inflammation, and enhancing gut-brain axis communication.
The gut microbiome’s two dominant bacterial phyla are Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, and their
relative abundance (the Firmicutes:Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio) is often considered a broad indicator of
gut “balance” or dysbiosis. (Schleupner and Carmichael 2022). Studies have shown how by
increasing the diversity of taxa can increase the posibilities for individuals to produce certain health
beneficial metabolites such as Urolithin A (Schleupner and Carmichael 2022), or increase omega 3
metabolism (Zinkow et al. 2024) and reduce down stream harmful gut metabolites (Brown, Clardy,
and Xavier 2023).
Studies have shown conflicting results in categorising micro biata of ADHD subjects and in general
the taxonomy is still evolving. (Wang et al. 2024) noted reduced levels of beneficial bacteria such as
Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Bifidobacterium, but conversely (Aarts et al. 2017) found that
individuals with ADHD had slightly increased Bifidobacterium. Aarts highlighted that just naming a
genus like Bifidobacterium doesn’t reveal its functional impact i..e while one species produce anti-
inflammatory SCFAs; another they found spiked phenylalanine levels; the key is really dealing with
gut bacteria at the strain level.
The gut brain axis
The gut-brain connection may also play a significant role in the etiology of ADHD. Gut health
influences neurotransmitter production (e.g. serotonin, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and
dopamine). Even though gut produced neurotransmitters passing the Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) is
not confirmed in human studies, the precursors for neurotransmitters do cross the blood brain barrier
so that neurotransmitters can be produced in the brain directly. It is also understood that the Vagus
Nerve sends signals to the brain so gut based neurotransmitters can affect mood and motivation; with
vegal nerve stimulation having been proven in many therapeutic areas already(Austelle et al. 2022),
though many studies which illucidate clinical revevance remain in preclinical models(Bravo et al.
2011).
Prebioics and probiotics
Interventions such as prebiotics, probiotics, high-fiber diets, and fermented foods, collectively
referred to in emerging research as psychobiotics, have been associated with changes in attentional
vigilance(Schmidt et al. 2015) and mood regulation and reduced anxiety and cortisol (Johnstone et al.
2021). These effects are thought to be mediated through increased production of short-chain fatty
acids (SCFAs) like butyrate, which support intestinal barrier integrity, regulate immune responses,
and promote the synthesis of key neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin(Silva et al.
2020). While more large-scale clinical trials are needed, current research supports the gut
microbiome as a promising, non-invasive target for adjunctive ADHD treatment.

Short-Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs)
Diets rich in probiotics, prebiotics, and fiber (which help produce short-chain fatty acids like
butyrate, Propionate and lactate) can enhance gut health. Furthermore, a decreased microbial
diversity (alpha diversity) has also been reported in ADHD (Prehn-Kristensen et al. 2018) and may
contribute to ‘leaky gut’ syndrome and contribute to the low-grade systemic inflammation reported
in ADHD.
These are byproducts of fiber fermentation in the gut and have been linked to improving brain
function via either the gut-brain axis or in some cases such as Butyrate by crossing the blood brain
barrier. SCFAs play a crucial role in various physiological processes, including maintaining gut
health, modulating the immune system, and influencing brain function. A recent study (Steckler et al.
2024) showed the ADHD group exhibiting significantly lower levels of key SCFAs, including acetic,
propionic, isobutyric, isovaleric, and valeric acids, highlighting a distinct microbial and metabolic
profile.
Butyrate: Butyrate and other SCFA deficiencies have been linked to many neurological
disorders(Deng et al. 2019) including ADHD (Fan et al. 2019)but many of the studies are not in-
human studies or have been noted for other confounding factors in study design despite some
sensible stratification of study subjects (Checa-Ros et al. 2021; Kurokawa et al. 2024). Butyrate
deficiencies where also linked to ASD and melatonin production and loosely infered to have
relevance in ADHD populations due to symptom cross over and disorder pathways.
• Sleep Disorders: (Checa-Ros et al. 2021b) Also linked butyrate deficiencies to also
melatonin production and ASD, while loosely inferring relevance to ADHD
populations due to symptom cross over and disorder pathways. Sleep deprevation and
• Neuroinflammation Reduction: Butyrate has anti-inflammatory effects, potentially
reducing neuroinflammation associated with ADHD (Yunting Li et al. 2024)
• Energy Metabolism: Butyrate supports mitochondrial function, enhancing brain
energy metabolism, which may help with cognitive impairments seen in ADHD (Rose
et al. 2018) while also aiding in reducing cholesterol and neuroinflammation
(Cavaliere et al. 2022).
Propionate research suggests that increased propionate levels could help reduce
neuroinflammation(Grüter et al. 2023) and enhance cognitive function while protecting the blood-
brain barrier (Hoyles et al. 2018) and stimulate the secretion of norepinephrine, possibly benefiting
ADHD symptoms like attention and focus.
• Additionally, propionate might influence dopamine regulation (Mirzaei et al. 2021),
which plays a role in reward processing and impulsivity, key areas affected in ADHD.
low melatonin were also associted with a significant decrease in microbial diversity
and richnes. Sleep disorders can be present in up to 70% of ADHD patients so they
represent one of the most frequent comorbidities in children with ADHD(Cortese et
al. 2009) underscoring the potential of gut biome diversity and butyrate levels.

Bifidobacterium. A lowered abundance of Bifidobacterium longum in infancy has been associated with
increased risk of developing ADHD and Asperger syndrome in childhood.(Pärtty et al. 2015). The same
study also showed early administration of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG may reduce the risk of
ADHD and AS. A small study showed significant inprovements in childrens inattention and
hyperactivity with supplements of (Pivac et al. 2011) while the study also noted significant negative
correlations between N-Glycan biosynthesis; which is consistent with an indepth study of
glycosylation abnormalities in ADHD. (Pivac et al., 2011).
Lactobacillus was shown to product acetycholine in a study dating back to 1947(Stephenson,
Rowatt, and Harrison 1947) and such strains have also been show to be effective against Alzeimer’s
disease induced rat models(Nimgampalle 2017).
Several species in the Lactobacillus genus (recently reclassified into multiple genera) other popular
strains used in medical research include: Rhamnosus GG (L GG) which has been shown to stabilize
the gut permeability barrier by mucin production and antigen-specific immunoglobulin A production.
(Khailova et al. 2017)In addition, a recent experimental study has demonstrated that Lactobacillus
rhamnosus regulates, again via the vagus nerve, emotional behavior and the influences the central
GABAergic system and serotonin (Bravo et al. 2011).
Levilactobacillus brevis is one of the key bacteria known to produce GABA. It produces GABA through
the glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) pathway , where it converts glutamate into GABA (Cataldo et al. 2024).
This bacteria is active in L. brevis strains isolated from fermented foods, such as kimchi, yogurt, and
pickles. One isolated strain, CRL 2013 (Kim et al. 2009), found in quinoa sourdough (Chiş et al. 2020) ,
had very high nutrient and GABA profile.

Faecalibacterium is known for its anti-inflammatory properties. The scarcity of this genus could
potentially lead to overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which aligns with the high levels
of pro-inflammatory cytokines found in children with ADHD and it’s low levels correlating to
ADHD symptons in children(Jiang et al. 2018) and allergies such as Th2-mediated atopic disorders
like asthma and allergic rhinitis, which when present in children were associated with a 30–50%
higher chance of developing ADHD (Bull-Larsen and Mohajeri 2019).
7. Antioxidants (Oxidative Stress, Mitochondrial Health, NRF2 Activation)
Antioxidant networks for increased protection
While the body has multiple endogenous antioxidant defenses, including enzymes like superoxide
dismutase and glutathione peroxidase, these can become overwhelmed in states of chronic
inflammation, nutrient deficiency, or high metabolic demand. Lester Packer introduced the concept
of the "antioxidant network(Packer et al. 1997)," detailing how key compounds like vitamin E,
vitamin C, lipoic acid, glutathione, and CoQ10 have been shown to work synergistically and
regenerate each other in vivo.
The BRAIN diet will prioritize reducing dietary pro-oxidants and inflammatory triggers while
introducing a wide spectrum of antioxidant-rich foods. This approach is particularly important for the
brain, which consumes a disproportionate share of the body’s oxygen and contains lipid-rich
neuronal membranes that are highly susceptible to peroxidation. In neurodevelopmental conditions
such as ADHD, there is increasing recognition that oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and
neuroinflammation contribute to cognitive, emotional, and behavioral dysregulation (A. A. J. Verlaet
et al. 2019) (Ogutlu, Kasak, and Tabur 2023).
Although high-dose antioxidant supplements have shown inconsistent or even harmful effects in the
rare case of the Vitamin E clinical trials and prostate cancer(Klein et al. 2011), diets rich in natural
antioxidant compounds have demonstrated robust benefits. The Green Mediterranean Diet DIRECT-
PLUS studies, led to significantly greater reductions in visceral adipose(Zelicha et al. 2022) and

neuroprotective effects(Pachter et al. 2024)(Pachter et al. 2024). This effect was accompanied by
increases in microbiome-derived metabolites like urolithin A, reinforcing the synergistic role of
polyphenols, fiber, and gut-derived antioxidants in improving metabolic and cognitive resilience.
The framework of the BRAIN Diet embraces:
• The acknowledge of the theoretical strength of the antioxidant network i.e. working many
different antioxidants into the diet and precursors for endogenous antioxidants
• Emphasize food-based sources rich in polyphenols, flavonoids, and balanced antioxidants.
• Avoid promoting high-dose single-nutrient supplementation unless there's clinical
justification and consultation and agreement with healthcare professionals
• Highlight synergy in whole-foods, not megadoses of any one food source.
Isothiocyanates (ITCs) like sulforaphane, found in broccoli, have also shown promising results in
reducing oxidative stress and offering protection against various chronic diseases, including cancer
and cardiovascular disorders while also showing higher bioavailability than other polyphenol-based
dietary supplements that also activate Nrf2.(Houghton, Fassett, and Coombes 2016)
Complex Antioxidant Networks and Mineral Cofactors
The antioxidant family also includes essential minerals that serve as cofactors for antioxidant
enzymes. Selenium, zinc, and manganese, for instance, are crucial for the proper functioning of
various antioxidant systems within the body(Mocchegiani and Malavolta 2019). This intricate
network of antioxidants works synergistically (Vertuani, Angusti, and Manfredini 2004), with each
component complementing the others to maintain cellular health and prevent oxidative damage.
Sourced from a wide variety of ‘functional foods’(Pouille et al. 2022), particularly fruits, vegetables,
nuts, and whole grains, antioxidants extend their mechanisms of action beyond simple free radical
scavenging to include metal ion chelation. Heavy metals are detoxified in the body by
metallothionein (MT) metal carrier proteins that must bind with Zn and copper (Cu) (Zhai et al.
2015)(Zhai et al., 2015), ADHD has been linked with metals contamination and UPFs which contain
among other additives high amounts of metals, particularly in food colourings; ADHD and other
neuropsychiatric disorders have been also linked to maternal food habits such as high UPF
consumption.(Dufault et al. 2024) . Besides heavy metals micro/nanoplastics (MNPs) are being
linked to many diseases, reproductive health and ADHD; (J. Zhang et al. 2025). Anthocyanins,
especially C3G-rich sources like berries, purple potatoes, and black goji, serve as:
• Natural chelation agents for heavy metals and environmental contaminants
• Neuroprotective molecules that support synaptic resilience and detox pathways
• Detox allies against microplastics and hormone-disrupting pollutants
Phenolic acids represent some of the most abundant antioxidants in plant-based foods, with whole
grains and bran being especially rich sources. Among these, ferulic acid stands out as a key
compound illustrating how food matrix effects translate into brain resilience. Processing methods
such as sprouting and fermentation release bound ferulic acid, enhancing bioavailability. Once
absorbed, it crosses the blood–brain barrier, scavenges reactive oxygen species, and synergizes with
vitamins C and E to stabilize neuronal membranes and preserve DHA. Such mechanisms highlight

why dietary patterns emphasizing whole, minimally processed grains may deliver neuroprotective
effects beyond their macronutrient profile.
Carotenoids, particularly lutein, zeaxanthin, and β-carotene, play a neuroprotective role through their
antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. These fat-soluble pigments accumulate selectively in
neural tissues, including the retina and brain, where they help scavenge reactive oxygen species and
stabilize cell membranes (Johnson 2014)(Johnson, 2014). Lutein and zeaxanthin, for instance, have
been associated with improved cognitive performance, especially in domains such as memory,
processing speed, and visual-spatial function (Yagi et al. 2021) (Lieblein-Boff et al., 2015;
Vishwanathan et al., 2014). β-carotene, as both an antioxidant and vitamin A precursor, also supports
immune regulation and neuronal development. Carotenoids are abundant in leafy greens, orange and
yellow vegetables, corn, and egg yolks. Their absorption is enhanced by dietary fat, and their
preservation and bioavailability is influenced by cooking techniques, with excessive oxidation during
high-speed mixing or prolonged exposure to heat shown to degrade carotenoid levels. Research
shows(Eliášová et al. 2020) that most of the antioxidant anthocyanins in colored-grain wheat are
destroyed during traditional breadmaking, with retention often dropping below 30%. If processing is
optimized e.g., sourdough fermentation, high-heat short baking etc this can be reduced. while
prolonged cooking increases access to lycopene in tomatoes where cell walls need to be broken
down(Fielding et al. 2005).

Mitochondrial Dysfunction
Mitochondrial dysfunction has been found to be linked to the susceptibility and development of many
major psychiatric and neurodevelopmental diseases: Alzheimer’s(Aran and Singh 2023) Parkinsons
(Henrich et al. 2023), Major Depressive Disorder (Y. Song et al. 2023), ADHD (Verma et al. 2016)
,(Ogutlu, Kasak, and Tabur 2023) and more limited studies correlating it to ASD (Lombard
1998)(Khaliulin, Hamoudi, and Amal 2025). Recent studies have shown how mitochondrial
dysfunction (MD) can lead to dopamine dysregulation, oxidative stress(Wesselink et al. 2019), and
cognitive impairments, all features of ADHD.

While little work has been done on connecting ADHD to mitochondrial dysfunction there are
scientific findings supporting dietary antioxidant treatment of ADHD which accounted for substantial
alterations in the immune system, epigenetic regulation of gene expression, and oxidative stress
regulation in ADHD and how immune dysfunction resulting in increased IgE levels might be another
link between ADHD and allergies(A. Verlaet et al. 2018; Wesselink et al. 2019b)By supplying a
spectrum of antioxidants (vitamins C and E, polyphenols, carotenoids, omega 3 (discussed above))
alongside mitochondrial supports (CoQ₁₀, lipoic acid, B-vitamins, k2) and trace minerals (selenium,
zinc, copper), we can potentially increase the protection of neurons, preserve mitochondrial energy
production, and reduce harmful inflammatory cascades, creating a better basis for optimal cognitive
and emotional resilience.

• Animal models: Impaired mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens has been shown
to reduce social dominance behaviours in mice (Zalachoras et al. 2022)Strikingly,
supplementation with nicotinamide, a dietary precursor to NAD⁺, restored mitochondrial
efficiency and reversed these behavioural deficits in an anxiety-expressing mouse model
((Hollis et al. 2015). This suggests that mitochondrial bioenergetics are not only
mechanistically linked to behaviour, but also potentially reversible through targeted
nutritional support.
• Human data: Large-scale analyses reinforce this connection. Using UK Biobank data, (Liu
et al. 2023)identified significant associations between mitochondrial DNA variants
(mtSNPs) and anxiety phenotypes, including elevated GAD-7 scores and self-reported
anxiety. Importantly, these effects were amplified in the presence of systemic inflammation
(C-reactive protein), indicating a mitochondria–immune–linked behaviour t
ATP for Mitochondrial Energy
Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) is the primary energy carrier in all cells and is crucial for maintaining
normal cellular function ATP production decreases as a result of mitochondrial dysfunction. ATP
markers from are associated with better global cognitive performance (MoCA scores) in
healthy older adults(Lopez et al. 2023). In individuals with ADHD, mitochondrial
dysfunction can lead to reduced ATP production, neurochemical imbalances, oxidative stress which
impacts brain energy metabolism, cognition and attention (Ogutlu, Kasak, and Tabur 2023; Walther
et al. 2023)..
Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD⁺) is a central coenzyme in oxidative phosphorylation,
acting as an electron carrier that enables ATP generation. Incorporating NAD+ precursors into the
BRAIN Diet reinforces mitochondrial energy metabolism, particularly in contexts of deficiency.
Patients with adult-onset mitochondrial myopathy, niacin supplementation (750–1,000 mg/day)
successfully restored blood and muscle NAD+ levels, up to eightfold, and improved mitochondrial
biogenesis and muscle performance (Pirinen et al. 2020) underscoring niacin’s potential as an
effective dietary intervention for enhancing mitochondrial function.
Incorporating NAD⁺ precursors into the BRAIN Diet—such as niacin (vitamin B₃), nicotinamide
riboside, or tryptophan—can reinforce mitochondrial energy metabolism, particularly in states of
deficiency. In patients with adult-onset mitochondrial myopathy, high-dose niacin supplementation
(750–1,000 mg/day) restored blood and muscle NAD⁺ levels by up to eightfold, improved
mitochondrial biogenesis, and enhanced muscle performance (Pirinen et al., 2020).By sustaining
NAD⁺ availability, mitochondrial ATP production remains efficient, supporting the neuronal energy
demands required for sustained attention, motivation, and goal-directed behavior.
These findings reinforce the importance of nutrient strategies within the BRAIN
Diet that support NAD⁺ availability, glutathione synthesis, and mitochondrial
health—such as niacin-rich foods (e.g., salmon, chicken breast, turkey, peanuts,
and mushrooms), sulphur-containing vegetables that provide glutathione
precursors (e.g., broccoli, Brussels sprouts, garlic, onions), and polyphenol-rich

hazardous reactive oxygen species ROS, oxidative stress arises. Increased oxidative stress has been
linked to cellular damage, DNA repair system malfunction, and in turn mitochondrial dysfunction
(MD)(Solleiro-Villavicencio and Rivas-Arancibia 2018a).
High levels of can cause astrocytes and microglia to become activated; reactive astrocytes can release
pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g.,ADHD associated biomarkers IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α (Chang et al.
2020a)), exacerbating inflammation and neuronal damage creating a vicious cycle (Solleiro-
Villavicencio and Rivas-Arancibia 2018b) This vicious circle may increase the risk of ADHD
pathogenesis. Also, increased H2O2 due to MD may play a functional role in ADHD by suppressing
dopamine release in the striatum pathway. This may be one of the possible mechanisms underlying
dopamine deficiency in the frontostriatal pathway in ADHD.
Glutathione (GSH) is one of the body's major antioxidants. Low levels may suggest oxidative
stress,; elevated GSH levels which have been recorded against ADHD subjects may also reflect a
compensatory response to increased oxidative stress (Verlaet et al. 2019). Furthermore,
mitochondrial metabolism of lactate depends on GSH for ROS neutralization, optimizing
mitochondrial energy use.
Other key antioxidants
Many other studies have been carried out looking at antioxidant agentsas modulators of
mitochondrial function(Vásquez-Reyes et al. 2021) and antioxidants such as quercetin showing
efficacy in reducing oxidative stress and related improvements in symptons for ADHD and ASD

symptons, (Boots, Haenen, and Bast 2008), potentially due to quercetin’s link to enhancing
mitochondrial baseline activity and energy production(Davis et al. 2009).
Quercetin is an effecive antioxidant agent which scavenges ROS(Boots, Haenen, and Bast 2008) and
has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-neuroinflammatory and neuroprotective
properties(Tongjaroenbuangam et al. 2011). Isoquercetin (glycosylated quercetin) is more completely
absorbed than quercetin in the aglycone form, and that the simultaneous ingestion of quercetin with
vitamin C, folate and additional flavonoids improves bioavailability(Y. Li et al. 2016). Also studies
have shown quercetin bound to a sugar molecule forming quercitrin has anti-inflammatory and anti-
oxidative effects may be augmented by the co-ingestion of N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and olive
oil (Camuesco et al. 2006).
The estimated flavonoid intake ranges from 50 to 800 mg/day (About 75% of dietary polyphenol
count is quercetin(Y. Li et al. 2016)). It is abundant in capers (Neveu V et al database 2010), apples ,
onions, berries, kale and soybeans.
Genistein a soy-derived isoflavonoid, has shown potential as a modulator of several biochemical
pathways, including the endocannabinoid system and neuroinflammation (Fuloria et al. 2022),
potentially enhancing the activity of certain endocannabinoids like anandamide (Thors, Eriksson, and
Fowler 2007). It has been confirmed to have the ability to alleviate the deleterious effects of
oxidative stress on neuronal injury, such as preventing neuronal death, increasing the production of
hippocampal glutathione (GSH) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), and lowering lipid peroxidation,
ROS, and nitric oxide production. Since genistein is believed to pass the blood–brain barrier to exert
its neuroprotective effect, it is extensively applied in the investigation of the treatment of
neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s and Huntington’s(Fuloria et al. 2022).
Coenzyme (CoQ10): This antioxidant and energy production cofactor has been associated with
ADHD and levels may be improved through supplementation(Mantle and Hargreaves 2024). CoQ10
deficiency leads to reduced ATP production and mitochondrial dysfunction, which may contribute to
the neurocognitive issues in ADHD (Szulc et al., 2018) . The decline in presence of CoQ10 in
humans with age; is dramatic with over 50% depletion between 20 years of life and 60 years which
also relates to dietary levels in animal organ meats which are the number one dietary source. Low
levels of the coenzyme B6 can cause dysfunctions, prior to the formation of vitamin Q10, to
DNA(Pravst, Zmitek, and Zmitek 2010). Organ meats are the highest source at upto 12mg per 100g,
with olive oil being the the highest plant source though at .06- 2mg per 100g it is not possible to
match therapeutic level doses. With great variations between producers and harvest time having been
noted , total CoQ dropped by 53%-56% between three weeks of the harvesting of two brands
(Zmitek, Rodríguez-Aguilera, and Pravst 2014; Deichmann, Lavie, and Andrews 2010).

Key Compounds Supporting Mitochondrial Function
Several amino acid–derived nutrients and other cofactors are integral to sustaining mitochondrial
energy production, buffering oxidative stress, and preserving neuronal function. These compounds
often originate from dietary proteins but exert systemic effects beyond neurotransmitter synthesis.

8. Insulin resistance and Metabolic disorders with ADHD
Insulin Dysregulation in ADHD and Brain Function
ADHD and some other neuropsychiatric conditions (e.g., ASD, Bipolar, Major Depressive Disorder
[MDD]) may represent a cluster of disorders influenced by brain-specific insulin
dysregulation(Fanelli et al., n.d.). Insulin is essential to brain function, modulating neurotransmitter
balance, synaptic plasticity, and cellular energy metabolism.
Metabolic alterations, primarily obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes, have emerged as
frequent comorbidities in individuals with ADHD, suggesting a bidirectional relationship between
neurodevelopmental and metabolic dysfunction; (Marcelli, Capece, and Caturano 2025) highlighted
overlapping pathogenetic pathways and genetic loci between metabolic disorders and ADHD (figure
X below). While a causal relationship in either direction is not clear (Faraone et al. 2021) stated that
such disorders ‘share a pathophysiology in the biological pathways that
dysregulate neurodevelopment and create brain variations leading to disorder onset’

Interconnected Dysregulation: Appetite, Inflammation, and Energy
ADHD is marked by multi-system dysregulation, extending beyond neurotransmission to include
appetite, circadian rhythm, inflammation, and energy regulation. These systems are deeply
interdependent, dysfunction in one domain amplifies dysfunction in others. For example, fatigue-
induced sugar cravings may temporarily compensate for low dopamine or energy, but over time
exacerbate insulin resistance and systemic inflammation. In turn, chronic inflammation can spill into
the brain (neuroinflammation), impairing neurotransmitter synthesis and contributing towards
mitochondrial dysfunction. Simultaneously, gut dysbiosis driven by poor food choices further
disrupts neurotransmitter support and immune signaling, while impaired glucose and insulin control
fuels additional metabolic and cognitive instability. This feedback loop of dysregulation highlights
the need for dietary frameworks, such as the BRAIN Diet, that address all these challenges in
concert.

Metabolic Syndrome and the Need for Dietary Integration
Insulin resistance is a hallmark of metabolic syndrome, which elevates the risk for cardiovascular
disease, central obesity, and type 2 diabetes. Individuals with ADHD show a significantly higher risk
of developing metabolic syndrome (Engström et al. 2003) reinforcing the need to address metabolic
health within any brain-focused dietary approach.

The brain relies heavily on glucose for energy. Poor glucose regulation, such as in hypoglycemia or
glucose intolerance, can impair cognitive function and worsen ADHD symptoms, including difficulty
concentrating and mood instability. Studies have found individuals with ADHD may have altered
glucose uptake in brain regions involved in attention and impulse control in both inattentive and
hyperactive children(Zametkin et al. 1990).
(Zelicha et al. 2022) The Green Mediterranean Diet study produced greater visceral adipose tissue
(VAT) loss than MED or control (≈ −14.1% vs −6.0% vs −4.2%); VAT loss tracked with higher total
plasma polyphenols and with the microbiome-derived markers urolithin A (via ellagitannins:
walnuts/pommegranate) and hippuric acid Green tea catechins (e.g., EGCG, EGC) (. Proteomics
suggest VAT reduction is accompanied by shifts in adiposity-related pathways. Parallel analyses
(Pachter et al. 2024) showed MED/green-MED attenuated brain atrophy by ~50%, with glycemic
control contributing to the neuroprotective signal—consistent with a polyphenol–fiber–microbiome
synergy improving metabolic and brain aging phenotypes.

In ADHD, inefficient glucose metabolism or insulin resistance may increase lactate levels, while
lactate can fuel the brain during periods of high demand, excessive lactate levels can contribute to
neuronal dysfunction leading to cognitive deficits, mental fatigue, and attention difficulties.
PPAR/RXR and metabolic health and brain function
The regulation of adipose tissue by nuclear receptors such as PPAR-α and PPAR-γ plays a central
role in the interplay between metabolic health and brain function, an axis increasingly implicated in
ADHD. Adipose tissue expresses a suite of genes involved in lipid metabolism, insulin sensitivity
and inflammation , all of which are under the transcriptional control of PPARs(Marx et al. 2004).
Omega-3 fatty acids serve as partial agonists for both PPAR-α (which promotes fatty acid oxidation
and mitochondrial efficiency) and PPAR-γ (which regulates adipocyte differentiation and anti-
inflammatory adipokine release). Activation of these receptors by EPA and DHA improves insulin
signaling and suppresses pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, shifting adipose tissue toward a
metabolically protective phenotype.
Inflammation originating from dysfunctional adipose is known to cross the blood–brain barrier and
disrupt neural signaling. Through its emphasis on anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitizing foods,
the BRAIN Diet seeks to restore adipose metabolic flexibility, lower peripheral cytokine load, and
reduce neuroinflammation, thereby creating a more favorable neuroimmune environment for
cognitive stability, dopamine regulation, and long-term attentional control. By also incorporating
nutrients such as magnesium(Cazzola et al. 2024), polyphenols (e.g., quercetin, resveratrol), B
vitamins, and short-chain fatty acids (e.g., from prebiotic fiber), the diet aims to improve
mitochondrial biogenesis and lipid oxidation in white adipose tissue, particularly visceral fat, which
is a key source of low-grade systemic inflammation. EPA and DHA may also enhance gut
microbiome diversity and reduce neuroinflammatory cytokines like IL-6 and TNF-α, supporting both
brain and gut health (Chang et al. 2020a) (Zinkow et al. 2024).
DHA-induced PPARγ-RXRα activation has been shown to enhance synaptic remodeling, neuronal
survival, and cognitive resilience (Majou and Dermenghem 2024) , supporting its mechanistic
relevance in neurodevelopmental disorders such as ADHD. Additionally, PPAR activation mediates
mitochondrial biogenesis and lipid handling in astrocytes and microglia, reinforcing omega-3’s role
in sustaining neuroenergetic stability and long-term cognitive health(Corona and Duchen 2016).

HPA Axis, ANS Dysregulation, and Their Role in Metabolic and ADHD Symptoms
The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and autonomic nervous system (ANS) are central
regulators of the body's response to stress. Dysregulation in either system is increasingly recognized
in ADHD and contributes not only to emotional dysregulation and cognitive dysfunction, but also to
metabolic imbalances such as insulin resistance and disrupted appetite signaling.
Research shows that children and adults with ADHD often display an abnormal cortisol rhythm or a
blunted cortisol awakening response (Isaksson et al. 2012; Chang et al. 2020b; Jue et al. 2023).
Genetic studies support this with polymorphisms in HPA-related genes like NR3C1(Fortier et al.
2013; Carpena et al. 2022) (Fortier et al., 2013; Carpena et al., 2022) These hormonal irregularities
may reduce resilience to stress and increase susceptibility to impulsivity, anxiety, and poor decision-
making.
HPA axis dysfunction also influences neurotrophins like BDNF(Ziaei et al. 2024), which may either
increase (as a compensatory response to chronic low cortisol) or decrease (especially in inattentive
subtypes), affecting neuroplasticity and synaptic development(S.-J. Tsai 2003; 2017).
Meanwhile, ANS dysfunction in ADHD, marked by low parasympathetic tone and high sympathetic
dominance, can manifest as poor heart rate variability, heightened reactivity, and disrupted
sleep(French et al. 2023). These patterns promote increased cravings, poor glucose regulation, and
disrupted leptin and ghrelin signaling, leading to unhealthy eating behaviors and weight gain with the
potential for escalating into more serious metabolic disorders (Spiegel, Leproult, and Van Cauter
1999), (Benedict et al. 2011).
While targeted nutrition can do much to counteract stress, stabilize energy and influence
neurotransmitter levels, it is not always best to eat just to spike neurotransmitters. It is critical to
recognize when fatigue is better addressed through non-dietary interventions. Light physical activity
(e.g., a brisk 10-minute walk) and mindful breathwork can activate the dopaminergic and
parasympathetic systems, respectively, improving mood and reducing stress-induced cravings,
With combinations of lifestyle and dietary interventions these systems can be brought back towards
balance:
• Sleep hygiene - supports cortisol regulation and reduces sympathetic dominance ((Checa-Ros
et al. 2023); (Michael R Lyon 1, n.d.).).
• Moderate physical activity (see below) - improves parasympathetic tone, stabilizes glucose
metabolism, and modulates adenosine and dopamine pathways (Ratey and Loehr 2011)
• Mindful eating and stress-reduction practices reduce cortisol and improve appetite regulation
(Torske et al. 2024; Katterman et al. 2014)(Torske et al., 2024; Katterman et al., 2014).
• Complementary dietary approaches - Fast mimicking diet(Rangan et al. 2022), Time
restricted Feedinghas been shown to reduce insulin sensitivity (Sutton et al. 2018) , high
polyphenols have been shown to reduce viseral adiposity, see above (Zelicha et al. 2022).
o Note: Fasting has been shown to increase cortisol which can stimulate appetite, alter
mood and memory and alter peripheral metabolism in favor of weight gain(Nakamura,
Walker, and Ikuta 2016), so fasting should be carefully observed for those with high
cortisol and stress. With ADHD there is often a sensitivity to stress responses seeing
many increased negative biological and psychological affects be it, inflammation,

• Specific dietary compounds - taurine and adenosine-regulating nutrients (e.g., green tea
polyphenols, plant-based methyl donors i.e. folate, choline, betaine) offer dietary leverage
points for modulating the HPA axis and restoring neurotransmitter balance (Md. Jakaria a,
n.d.) (Q. Jia et al. 2024)
Adenosine: Adenosine is a critical regulator of dopamine signaling, sleep, inflammation, and neural
plasticity, all of which are closely tied to ADHD symptoms. It is typically generated from the
breakdown of ATP which increases during the day creating sleep ‘pressure’. Imbalances in adenosine
signaling can contribute to symptoms of ADHD(Valladão et al. 2024), such as inattention and
hyperactivity.
Taurine is a sulfur-containing, semi-essential amino acid that occurs naturally in the body. It plays a
protective role in modulating inflammation and oxidative stress in various disease models. Studies
(Md. Jakaria a, n.d.) indicate that taurine may prevent neurotoxicity, stabilize neurotransmitter
balance, and support cognitive health. It also exhibits adaptogenic properties by buffering the brain
against chronic stress and regulating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, including the
reduction of cortisol levels. There have been studies in rat ADHD models showing positive
improvements for attention and hyperactivity but not not in-human. Meats and shell fish can provide
it direct or foods containing precursor cysteine (Wójcik et al. 2010)
9. -Aligned Foods & Metabolic Regulators (Stress, Fasting, Chrono-Nutrition,)
• Best foods for morning vs. evening (protein vs. complex carbs for energy)
• Carb timing for ADHD energy regulation
• Melatonin precursors & night-time foods (cherries, pistachios, tart cherry juice)
• Caffeine, circadian rhythms, & ADHD focus
• Exercise
Aligning nutrient intake with circadian and activity rhythms represents a precision-based upgrade to
static dietary planning. Also in light of many medications, particularly amphetamines, a blunting of
the appetite is experienced, therefore nutrient loaded for breakfast is even more important (Nancy
Clark 2022).
We discussed above how nutritional strategies can determine which amino acids are encouraged to
cross the BBB, but beyond that it has to be considered which foods and drinks are taken at what
times of the day in keeping with circadiam rhythms.

Table 8 - Circadian support of Neurotransmitters.
Exercise-aligned nutritional timing should be an integral component of all ADHD dietary plans.
Physical activity triggers a cascade of neurochemical and metabolic shifts that enhance the brain's
receptivity to specific nutrients, particularly those involved in neurotransmitter synthesis,
mitochondrial function, and neuroplasticity. For example, post-exercise windows offer heightened
sensitivity to glucose and amino acids, making it an ideal time to deliver precursors like tyrosine
(dopamine), tryptophan (serotonin), magnesium, and omega-3s to support recovery and cognitive
resilience. Moreover, exercise-induced BDNF surges can be potentiated by polyphenols(Davis et al.
2009) , DHA, and curcumin consumed within this window, suggesting a synergistic opportunity to
enhance mood and learning consolidation.
Physical activity, when aligned with circadian timing, not only entrains peripheral clocks but also
enhances neuroplasticity, BDNF secretion, and mitochondrial efficiency , all of which are core to the
BRAIN diet’s objectives. Strategic timing of exercise may therefore amplify the cognitive and
metabolic benefits of the dietary protocol, particularly in populations with circadian disruption such
as ADHD.
Exercise: Enhancing Neuroplasticity and Nutrient Synergy
Physical activity plays a crucial role in any ADHD dietary strategy, not only for its well-established
benefits on mood and focus but also for how it shapes the body's metabolic and neurochemical
environment. Exercise induces a cascade of physiological changes, such as increased blood flow,
elevated BDNF (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor), improved insulin sensitivity, and enhanced
mitochondrial activity, that temporarily heighten the brain’s receptivity to key nutrients.
These post-exercise windows present an optimal time to deliver nutrients critical to neurotransmitter
synthesis and brain recovery. For example, amino acids like tyrosine and tryptophan, essential for

dopamine and serotonin production respectively, are more efficiently utilized after physical exertion.
Similarly, magnesium, omega-3 fatty acids, and B-vitamins—which support ATP production and
neuronal signaling—can have amplified effects when timed alongside or following activity.
Moreover, exercise-induced BDNF surges can be synergistically potentiated by polyphenols (e.g.,
blueberries, green tea, Davis et al., 2009), DHA, and curcumin, all of which may enhance learning
consolidation, synaptic growth, and emotional regulation. These interactions highlight the value of
nutrition-exercise coupling as an underused therapeutic lever in ADHD management.
Timing also matters. Physical activity early in the day helps align circadian rhythms, regulate cortisol
release, and entrain peripheral clocks, supporting improved sleep, appetite regulation, and metabolic
stability—all frequently disrupted in ADHD. This makes circadian-aligned exercise not only a
metabolic tool, but a core component of the BRAIN diet’s strategy to restore homeostasis in
neurodivergent populations.
Neurochemical Rhythms and Chrono-Nutrition
Neurotransmitter activity follows circadian rhythms that may influence how the brain responds to
specific nutrients throughout the day. Dopamine and cortisol tend to peak in the morning,
supporting alertness and goal-directed behaviour, while serotonin and melatonin rise toward the
evening, modulating mood, impulse control, and sleep. Aligning nutrient intake with these natural
rhythms - such as prioritising tyrosine- and phenylalanine-rich foods earlier in the day, and
tryptophan-rich, carbohydrate-supported meals later on - may enhance neurochemical synthesis
and receptor sensitivity. This chrono-nutritional approach offers an additional lens through which
to personalise dietary strategies for cognitive regulation, especially in neurodevelopmental
conditions like ADHD.

Culinary vs. Therapeutic Use of Herbs and Spices
Initial clinical trials that test the diet should emphasize the use of herbs and spices in culinary
amounts, those typically found in traditional cuisines, rather than the high-dose medicinal levels
often used in isolated clinical research. The core efficacy of the BRAIN Diet must rest on its
integrated framework of precision dietary strategies, nutrient density, and food matrix interactions,
rather than any one concentrated intervention. That said, future trials should explore therapeutic
levels of specific spices or adaptogens (e.g. curcumin, saffron, gingerols) where targeted modulation
of dysregulated biological systems is warranted.
Food synergies with spices for targeting dysregulated systems
There will be moments when individuals experience serious dysregulation in one biologic system,
or more, and when the diet could be used to target certain systems or pathways i.e. increasing the
inflammatory dietary targets such as certain spices, higher omega 3 and polyphenol combinations.
In such instances raising targeted active ingredients towards therapeutic levels might be beneficial
if a medication model is not desired. Many spices have been used in clinical trials against the core
bio systems dysregulation that the BRAIN diets targets and many members of the Zingiberaceae
family (which includes ginger, turmeric, and galangal) have pleiotropic effects overlapping between
metabolic regulation and neurocognitive outcomes. By reducing inflammation and oxidative stress,
these herbs and spices can modulate neurotransmitter production, improve mitochondrial function,
potentially improving reducing anxiety, and improving cognitive performance.

Curcumin - Systematic reviews affirm that curcumin supplementation can improve memory
performance in older adults and enhance overall cognitive function in both healthy and at-risk
populations . However, curcumin’s benefits may depend on
formulation due to its poor natural bioavailability
When to Seek Medical Advice
Any significant dietary changes or use of high-dose supplements should be made in consultation with
a qualified healthcare professional.
Herbals and medication interactions
While culinary use of herbs and spices is generally safe, therapeutic doses may have potent biological
effects and could interact with medications or underlying conditions.
Functional Foods
The target spices above, the polyphenols, the foods with good amino acid ratios, the friendly gut
bacteria producing foods all form part of the functional food profile of the diet. Functional foods are
broadly defined as “foods that provide health benefits beyond basic nutrition,” often by improving
physiological functions or reducing disease risk. This includes naturally occurring foods like fatty
fish or fermented dairy, as well as foods enhanced through modern innovation, such as sprouted
grains, UV-grown mushrooms, or microencapsulated omega-3 oils. The FUFOSE (Functional Food
Science in Europe) model laid early groundwork for this definition. However, the food's functional
impact often depends upon it’s own matrix of physical structures and its components, it’s preparation
and deliver system if it is processed(Yu et al. 2023) and the interactions between different foods
consumed together, and how these collective effects influence digestion, absorption, metabolism, and
ultimately physiological function.
The BRAIN Diet embraces the functional food philosophy but deliberately moves away from
reductionist interpretations that isolate nutrients from the broader biological and food matrix context.
As we have highlight above omega 3 needs to bind to the correct phospholypids tryptophan will
compete with other LEAAs unless carbohydrates create an insulin spike, turmeric is not just a
curcumin supplement, it’s part of a culinary matrix that includes fats which with heat, can increase
enhance curcumin’s absorption.
Summary and Perspectives
This review paper comes at a prescient moment, when nutritional science is evolving rapidly.
We must now move toward a position where key precision nutrition facts are not only
published but also socialised into public knowledge and practice. This dietary program and
corpus of integrated science must now be further developed, also in support of other dietary
programs which could be improved such as Keto or FMD etc.

The dietary program must be continuously tested and developed at scale across institutions
where targeted precision nutrition programs can really benefit individuals: schools, hospitals,
prisons, elder care, and corporate environments. Only then will we see a systemic shift
towards nutritional plans which support brain health and metabolic wellness.
To summarise:
1. Food Matrix & Precision Nutrition
• Understanding food matrix interactions is central to precision nutrition.
• Leveraging this science can help correct dysregulated biological systems targeted by the
BRAIN Diet, with implications for ADHD, cognitive health, metabolic health, and
neurodegenerative disease risk.
• Future research must expand laboratory studies into food matrix interactions and adopt FAIR
data principles to accelerate open collaboration.
2. Personalization & Diagnostics
• Diagnostic tools can guide personalization.
o Food sensitivity testing (IgG/IgA, elimination protocols) can uncover immune or
behavioral triggers.
o Genetic SNP testing (MTHFR, COMT, BDNF, CLOCK, PER3, FADS1/2) can reveal
individual predispositions that shape diet response..
3. Elimination Diets Reframed
Conventional Elimination
Diets The BRAIN Diet Approach
Remove all common
allergens Evaluate only short-term
behavior
Food seen as risk factor Limited nutrient attention One-size-fits-all exclusion No long-term sustainability Identify and remove individual triggers

4. Accessibility & Practical Application
• Adherence is about sustainable patterns, not perfection.
• Algorithms guiding weekly menus will be openly published and AI-assisted.
• Leaning on plant proteins improves affordability and reduces health risks linked to excess red
meat.

5. Nutrient Sufficiency Across Diet Types
• Certain neuroprotective nutrients (e.g., creatine, taurine, carnitine) are abundant in animal
foods.
• Trials offering both omnivorous and plant-based versions will clarify whether observed
benefits stem from animal-derived nutrients or compensatory advantages of plant-based diets
(e.g., lower inflammation).
6. Functional Foods & Innovation
• Functional foods (e.g., sprouted grains, functional breads, probiotic dairy, UV-grown
mushrooms, functional ice creams) fit within a systems framework, not as isolated solutions.
• Emerging technologies (microencapsulation, precision fermentation, biofortification) offer
delivery advantages but must complement, not replace, diverse whole-food patterns.
7. Broader Health & Societal Impact
• Since the systems addressed overlap with cardiovascular and metabolic health, the BRAIN
Diet also supports healthy ageing and lifespan.
• Implementation at scale across schools, hospitals, prisons, elder care, and workplaces could
drive systemic change in mental and metabolic wellness.
8. Call for Open Collaboration
• Nutrition science must move beyond publication into shared, open knowledge that is
integrated into practice.
• The BRAIN Diet can serve as a vehicle for collaboration across microbiome research,
neuronutrition, metabolic health, and food science.
• Clinical trials and deeper research into the food matrix remain essential. Many of the
biological mechanisms discussed below, such as gut microbiome composition, gut-brain axis
dynamics, and neurotransmitter regulation, are still emerging fields. They require further
exploration through larger, more nuanced human studies to strengthen their clinical relevance,
but some positive human studies exist and much preclinical research indicates dietary
interventions could be highly beneficial (Ciancarelli 2024).
As Ferran Adrià noted in the 2014 foreword to Nathan Myhrvold’s Modernist Cuisine series, “Now
is a good time to rethink how we teach cooking in schools… this lays a stepping stone to the future of
cooking.” A decade later, as advances in microbiome research, neuronutrition, metabolic health,
genomics, and food science continue to accelerate, these fields must converge into a cohesive whole.
The need for open collaboration, integration, and socialisation has never been greater. The BRAIN
Diet offers one such vehicle.

Before we eat (Lifestyle and Food choices):
1. Sustainability - – out of the scope of this paper but linked to plant based eating.
2. Contamination - Where we source are food from can indicate levels of certain pollutants i.e.
metals such as cadium and lead are high in chocolate from central and south America (Godebo et
al. 2024) though an USA analysis found vegetable and cereal products most affected by
industrial and environmental sources of contamination (Hands et al. 2024).
3. Histamine and Food Sensitivities (Histamine load and intolerance, using DAO co-factors like
vitamin C & B6, ). Gluten, IgE, IgG responses to food.(NHS, n.d.)
4. Lifestyle Factors (Sleep , exercise etc)
Food Choice by timing:
5. 6. Circadian Influence (e.g. meal timing, sleep-wake cues)
Additional Dietary Strategies – These can be implemented If blood results dictate or a period of
dietary inadherence suggests a particular dietary focus is needed i.e. to counter a period: low in
omega 3s, high inflammatory foods, or a lack of microbiome supporting nutrients.
Food Matrix Interactions:
7. Food Matrix Effects
8. 9. Precursors and cofactors (L-DOPA for dopamine)
Food Synergies (e.g. Turmeric + black pepper; omega-3 fatty acids needs to be esterified to
phospholipids to cross BBB, Non-heme Iron + vitamin C
10. Vitamin & Mineral Compatibility ( Vitamin D improves calcium absorption; vitamin C enhances
iron uptake from plant sources. Consuming fat with fat -soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K);)
11. Bioavailability isoquercetin (glycosylated quercetin) is more completely absorbed than quercetin
in the aglycone form, vitamin C improves querectin bioavailability. Bioavailability depends upon
many factors from individual genetics to food matrix and drug interactions.
Food Components
12. Carbohydrate Complexity (resistant, soluble, fermentation potential)
13. Anti-Inflammatory Index (e.g. omega-3, curcumin Fodmap)
14. Antioxidant Composition (e.g. glutathione, flavonoids, polyphenols)
15. Fat Composition (e.g. omega-3 to omega-6 ratio, MCTs, olive oil, avocado oil)
16. Protein Composition and quality (e.g. achieving complete amino acid profiles i.e. Pair legumes
with grains (e.g., beans + rice) to cover lysine and methionine gaps., digestibility, )
Biologic Targets
17. Insulin Response (e.g. glycemic load impact)
18. Microbiome Impact (e.g. SCFA production, prebiotics)
19. Hormonal Influence (e.g. insulin, cortisol, leptin sensitivity)
20. Mitochondrial Support (e.g. CoQ10, etc))
21. Neurotransmitter Support (e.g. tryptophan, choline)
22. Methylation & Epigenetic Modulation (e.g. B12, folate, betaine)
23. Endocannabinoid System Regulation (e.g. FAAH inhibition, omega-3)
24. Reduce glycation end products (RAGE effects) by reducing glucose spikes.

The dietary algorithm
The trained large language model (LLM), will be trained in the knowledge of those subjects
represented in Figure 1. The algorithim must be able to calculate individual variables and preferences
including: age, activity level, exercise habits, any known ADHD-related and other relevant genetic
polymorphisms (e.g., MTHFR, MAOA, VAL66MET etc). These personalized inputs will guide food
pairings and nutrient recommendations.
Because the actual bioavailability of nutrients depends on numerous interacting factors, many of
which are still under investigation, the algorithm must draw from the best available data as presented
within current regulatory labelling systems. Optimization of nutrient distribution across meals will be
guided by a knapsack-style model to balance precision with feasibility, defaulting to representative
values based on nutrient type, preparation method, and commonly observed food pairings.
The knapsack-style algorithm will be designed to evaluate and assemble food combinations that
collectively optimize a predefined set of key nutrients as outlined in this paper. Rather than
optimizing just individual meals in isolation, the algorithm operates across meals throughout each
day and over multiple days. All dietary targets will be met over the course of each weeks meal
plans, with nutrient timing strategies (e.g., BID dosing of short half-life nutrients) being factored in,
compensatory pairing of meals, and personalized adjustments based on metabolic, genetic, or
behavioral factors.
The fundamental vitamin and mineral RDAs will be based upon dietary guidelines i.e. WHO, BANT
with any adaptations based upon evidence, meal proportions in terms of percentage of protein,
carbohydrates, fats etc will be based upon these recommendations with reasonable shifts to keep
meals balanced and to target the dietary principles outlined in this paper. For upcoming clinical
trials the algorithim will aid the dieticians and chefs with meal plans to leverage the research areas in
figure 1 including the key biological and nutritional information and interactions highlighted in this
paper which will, alongside other supporting evidence, be used to train the LLM.
For individuals using the algorithim it will be possible to target any meals based upon personal or
nutritionist guided strategies to support the biological targets defined in the paper i.e. if inflammation
follows a period of eating pro-inflammatory foods then meals focusing on antioxidant rich foods and
endogenous antioxidant precurors can become a focus of each meal for a defined short period that
would not negatively affect other brain health goals.

Micronutrient Absorption
We note some are key considerations such as the vitamin and mineral synergies which need to be
factored into the diet to support brain health:
Vitamin C,
- significantly improves non-heme iron absorption by reducing ferric to ferrous iron,
with studies showing up to a fourfold increase when consumed together (Hallberg et al., 1989).
Vitamins A, D, E and K - Dietary fat enhances the absorption of these fat-soluble vitamins
(Tangpricha et al., 2003),
Zinc and magnesium – will competete and high-dose supplementation has been observed to
reduce absorption efficiency, warranting staggered intake when clinically necessary (Arnaud,
2008).
Iron - is an essential cofactor for tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the conversion
of tyrosine to dopamine (Beard et al., 2003; Erikson et al., 2000. Pairing plant-based iron sources
with citrus, fat-soluble vitamins with avocado or olive oil, or spreading minerals across meals are
simple but impactful strategies that support maximising dietary nutrition.
Proper preparation techniques — such as soaking, fermenting, sprouting, or cooking —
dramatically reduce the levels of problematic compounds while preserving or enhancing the
bioavailability of beneficial nutrients., making them less of a blanket concern and more a question of
dietary context. Similarly, tannins and saponins may inhibit nutrient uptake but also have anti-
inflammatory, antimicrobial, and anti-carcinogenic effects.
From a brain health perspective, the primary concerns are antinutrients that significantly impair the
availability of iron, zinc, magnesium, and B vitamins—nutrients critical for neurotransmitter
synthesis, myelination, and mitochondrial function. For individuals with ADHD or cognitive
impairments, diets overly reliant on high-phytate or high-oxalate foods without preparation methods
like soaking, fermenting, or boiling could exacerbate mineral imbalances. However, when traditional
preparation techniques are used, the potential downsides of antinutrients are largely mitigated
allowing their possible protective and regulatory roles to be retained without compromising brain-
supportive nutrition.
Cooking and Preparation methods to reduce oxidants and antinutrients
Alongside nutrient pairing, cooking methods and fat choices play a crucial role in the
nutritional quality of meals. While it is commonly held that steaming, baking, or light sautéing
helps maintain nutrient density and antioxidant content, sometimes larger benefits maybe
gained from boiling i.e. reducing oxalates and phytates in green vegetables such as spinach and
kale (Chai and Liebman 2005).
Because the BRAIN diet specifically targets leafy green vegetables i.e. kale and spinich that are
rich in iron, magnesium, and zinc this can introduce high dietary oxalate. Oxalate binds to these
minerals and forms insoluble compounds, which significantly reduces their bioavailability,

(Chaiyarit and Thongboonkerd 2020)also found that oxalate (CaOx crystals and NaOx)
negatively affects mitochondrial function and changes redox status in monocytes while also
affecting mitochondrial function.
While concerns that oxalate causes stones is often inflated, as only about 10% of people will
ever develop these in their lives(with 80% of those being oxolate crystal related), and only
about 2% of people are oxalate sensitive, the diet should feature meals that reduce the
absorption of oxalate and support the good foundational gut bacteria which help process
oxalate(Daniel et al. 2021).
Highly processed seed oils, such as soybean, sunflower, and corn oil, are high in omega-6 fatty
acids, which are unstable at high temperatures and proinflammatory. When heated, these oils
undergo oxidation, producing harmful lipid peroxides and advanced glycation end products
(AGEs)(Uribarri et al. 2010) These compounds act as local initiators of inflammation, triggering
cellular signaling pathways that increase production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as
interleukin-6 (IL-6). Elevated IL-6 c activates microglia, the brain’s immune cells, leading to a
state of neuroinflammation. This process has been implicated in altering neurotransmitter
function, synaptic plasticity, and dopaminergic signaling ((Ramsden et al.
2013);(Schwingshackl and Hoffmann 2014)).
Replacing industrial seed oils with more stable options like olive oil, ghee, or avocado oil,
especially for low- to medium-heat cooking, may reduce inflammatory load while preserving
beneficial polyphenols. The strategy of simply adding parsley when cooking food has seen
significant reductions in harmful COPs (Cholesterol Oxidation Products) (de Oliveira et al.
2022).
Soaking strategies to reduce phytates
Table X – Summary of Current and Topical Food Preparation & Interaction Strategies
Relevant to Brain Health
Besides cooking techniques, preparation techniques can also maximise nutrients and reduce
negative food content and synergy effects. Soaking and sprouting grains is one such method to
increase the bioavailability of iron by reducing phytates, the germination of grains increases
antioxidant and nutritional value also. (Luo and Xie 2014) . Just soaking beans at the right
temperature and pH level can activate endogenous phytases reducing the phytate content

Bread and Food Matrix effects example
Bread making is an example of how food preparation strategies can have a positive effect on the
reduction of harmful cooking bi-products and the introduction of good bi-products. (Coda, Rizzello,
and Gobbetti 2010) demonstrate the fermentation of quinoa flour, and other functional flours,
introduces natural GABA; also with the addition of Glycine, a common industrial practice, harmful
acrylamide can also be reduced (Fink et al. 2006). Proteolytic events that occur during sourdough
fermentation affect the overall quality of bread, this process sees the sourdough fermentation
enhances bioavailability of amino acids through activation of endogenous cereal proteases under
acidic conditions(Gänzle, Loponen, and Gobbetti 2008), and in some cases, microbial proteases
from lactic acid bacteria. This enzymatic activity is also associated with increased digestibility and
reduced immunogenicity of gluten peptides. By considering the synergy of ingredients, the optimal
application of time and heat, and the details within the cooking i.e. closed cooking pot i.e. dutch
over opposed to open oven; the end product will reap several synergistic health benefits ( Table 11
below).

A meta study(Naghshi et al. 2020) found that intake of total protein was associated with a lower risk
of all cause mortality, and intake of plant protein was associated with a lower risk of all cause and
cardiovascular disease mortality, their study found that increasing the amount of plant proteins by 3%
of energy from plant proteins a day was associated with a 5% lower risk of death from all causes.
(Sun et al. 2019) found that by increasing 5% energy from animal protein with plant protein was
associated with a 13% lower risk of all-cause mortality, while substituting a four ounce
equivalent/day of total red meat with poultry, fish/shellfish, or nuts, was associated with a 8%, a
12%, and a 12% lower risk of all-cause mortality, respectively.
While there are mixed results relating to the value of higher amounts of protein in health and
longevity, there are clearer positive signals to the correlation of muscle mass and longevity
(Srikanthan and Karlamangla 2014) and the associated health benefits, and longevity associated with
the reduction of sarcopenia(Coelho-Junior et al. 2022) and higher protein and exercise in combatting
anabolic resistance(Tezze, Sandri, and Tessari 2023) . Older adults may require higher protein intake
to prevent sarcopenia and functional decline (Houston et al. 2008) found that over 3 years the highest
quintile on approximately 1.1 g/kg/day of protein per day over the lowest quintile: approximately
0.7 g/kg/day experienced a 40% less loss of lean mass.

Sustainability
Importantly, a well-formulated vegan BRAIN Diet may offer distinct advantages in terms of
environmental sustainability, especially when grounded in regenerative agriculture and a wide
diversity of minimally processed plant foods. However, it is a misconception that all vegan foods are
inherently low-impact, factors such as processing intensity, long-distance transport, and monoculture
cropping must also be weighed, though whole foods are the focus; sometimes protein isolates and
….maybe necessary to create full food matrix synergies within meals.
Equally, the omnivore version of the BRAIN Diet is intentionally designed to be plant-forward,
emphasizing seasonal produce, legumes, whole grains, nuts, and fermented foods, while using small
amounts of high-impact animal products (e.g., organ meats, shellfish, eggs, or oily fish) for their
nutritional density. This approach not only minimizes ecological footprint per nutrient delivered, but
also aligns with principles of nutritional efficiency and dietary restraint, which are central to
sustainable food systems. In both cases—vegan or omnivore—closing the nutrient gap is not simply
about substitution, but about elevation: selecting high-function, bioactive-rich foods that can meet
complex neurobiological demands. When done strategically, brain health and environmental
stewardship can coexist without compromise.
