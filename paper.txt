Abstract –
For full guidelines please refer to Author Guidelines

ADHD, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, multiple sclerosis, and Alzheimer’s disease may share overlapping biological dysfunctions, including chronic inflammation, neurochemical imbalance, and mitochondrial impairment. Pharmacological treatments can alleviate symptoms but rarely address these root causes and may contribute to further dysregulation. Poor diet is another modifiable driver of these interconnected pathways. Evidence shows that targeted dietary interventions, particularly those incorporating polyphenols, omega-3 fatty acids, pre- and probiotics, and key micronutrients, can improve ADHD symptoms, especially in individuals who do not tolerate or respond to medication. This paper gives a narrative review plus a conceptual synthesizes of the current research on ADHD-related biological systems dysregulation and dietary support presenting the scientific rationale for the B.R.A.I.N. Diet (Bio-Regulation Algorithm and Integrated Neuronutrition), a precision, whole-food diet designed to optimize brain health through integrated nutritional strategies.

 1. Introduction

Overview of key dietary foundations
Neurodevelopmental disorders such as ADHD, ASD, and bipolar disorder, and neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease, have complex, multifactorial origins. Although the precise causes are not fully understood, these conditions share overlapping biological dysfunctions, including mitochondrial impairment, chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, impaired methylation, gut–brain axis disruption, glucose dysregulation, micronutrient deficiencies, and neurotransmitter imbalances (Figure 1). These interconnected systems, while not sole causes of such disorders, can contribute to symptom burden and overall metabolic and mental health. 
Rather than treating inflammation, circadian rhythm, or metabolism in isolation, the BRAIN diet integrates these biochemical systems highlights their interdependence i.e. how methylation fuels both neurotransmitter synthesis and membrane phospholipid turnover; or how gut-derived signals modulate HPA/ANS stress circuits and sleep.


  
Figure 1 – ADHD dysregulated systems
Targeting these pathways through nutrition offers a low-risk approach with potential to improve brain health and, in some cases, alleviate to some degree ADHD symptoms by optimising overall neurobiological function. Dietary interventions have been shown to slow cognitive decline (Agarwal et al. 2023; Katonova et al. 2022)  and may help stem progression from neurodevelopmental to neurodegenerative conditions ((Leffa et al. 2023; Zhang et al. 2022).  
An extensive literature review found no existing long term dietary protocol, that is both low-risk and comprehensive in applying a systems-based approach to improving brain health. Given the genetic overlap, shared biological mechanisms, and correlated symptom profiles among neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative conditions, we propose that a targeted brain health diet may offer more potential in reducing the wide-ranging and often debilitating symptoms that individuals with these disorders experience. The focus of this paper is anchored in ADHD and brain health which supports ADHD but also it is hypothesized that individuals experiencing other brain related conditions like ASD, Bipolar, Alzheimer’s etc  would benefit.
Our eventual aim is to develop and test in clinical trials dietary algorithms with the potential to reduce ADHD symptom burden by targeting multiple biological pathways. The diet is intended as an adjunct within a multimodal care plan, alongside non-pharmacological interventions (e.g., exercise, sleep and circadian support, mind–body practices) and, where appropriate, prescribed pharmacological treatments (e.g., stimulant or non-stimulant medication).
Neurodevelopmental conditions like ADHD, while traditionally viewed through a cognitive-behavioral lens, intersect with the same biological axes that drive the world’s leading causes of death , metabolic disorders. Thus, this dietary framework must, besides aiming to improve brain health,  also act preventatively against the related dysregulated bio systems driving  metabolic disease. Emerging data shows that ADHD is not only a disorder of attention, but a condition associated with reduced lifespan due to, elevated cardiometabolic risks as well as 3 fold occurrences of depression and anxiety  implicating the broader biological dysfunction that this protocol seeks to address. 
Researched dietary interventions for ADHD 
The most widely trialled dietary strategies for ADHD, historically have been:
•	Restricted Elimination Diets (RED)
•	Artificial Food Colour Elimination (AFCE)
•	Omega-3 / Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFA) supplementation
•	Targeted vitamin–mineral combinations
There have been several diets that focused on ADHD these include:  Restricted Elimination Diets (RED) (Rommelse and Buitelaar 2013)(Rommelse and Buitelaar 2013), Artificial Food Color Elimination (AFCE), Omega-3 fatty acids or Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFA) supplementation, and also targeted vitamin and mineral combination studies. A meta-analyses(Stevenson et al. 2014) (Stevenson et al. 2014) found the range of average effect sizes in standard deviation units as follows: RED (0.29–1.2), AFCE (0.18–0.42) and PUFA (0.17–0.31). 
The foundations of the Mediterranean diet ( high consumption of fruit, vegetables, legumes, olive oil, and moderate consumption of fish and white meat), are an excellent basis for improving overall health and these diets have shown some efficacy against a wide array of conditions like ADHD(Aksoy and Doguer 2025) (Darabi et al. 2022), Alzheimers (Morris et al. 2015) (Ashley Holub 2022), . Conversely studies have shown that an unhealthy western diet can trigger ADHD(Horner et al. 2025) (Howard et al. 2011). 

Other diets with  potential for ADHD – Keto and Fast Mimicking
Given the rising rates of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, or at least the identification of them, the need for evidence based  nutritional interventions to support cognitive function and mental health has never been more urgent. Recent dietary strategies such as the Ketogenic diet (Galali et al. 2024) and the Fast Mimicking Diet(Rangan et al. 2022) have contributed significantly to the field by demonstrating targeted metabolic and neurological benefits, while studies are still limited, and with mixed results larger more tightly controlled studies are needed (Omori et al. 2024). 
However, concerns remain regarding the long-term safety and feasibility of such approaches, for example the ketogenic diet, is associated with warnings against long term health concerns such as cardiac risk, poor lipid profiles and possible glucose intolerance (Crosby et al. 2021; Popiolek-Kalisz 2024; Joo et al. 2023; W. Li et al. 2024). Consideration of inducing ketosis via plant fats may reduce the health burden and prove equally effective(Fuehrlein et al. 2004).Meanwhile, the Fast Mimicking Diet is intended to be implemented upon five day cycles with the expectation that normal dietary habits resume after that period. 
The B.R.A.I.N Diet Overview
The BRAIN Diet  (Bio-Regulation Algorithm and Integrated Neuronutrition); for neuronutrition see (Badaeva et al. 2023) is A Mediterranean-Rooted Precision Nutrition Model . It is a plant-based leaning protocol i.e. (70% minimum energy minimum from plants). This paper highlights the advantages and possible nutritional shortcomings of vegan diets and while trying to address as many of these gaps as possible with natural food solutions, research shows that vegans commonly take essential supplements due to such shortfalls. 
While plants form the foundation providing essnential gut biome enriching nutrients, high polyphenol count targets and medicinal herbs and spices,  the omnivore version of the diet also incorporates nutrient-dense animal foods such as seafood, eggs, fermented dairy, occassional offal (Latoch et al. 2024)  i.e. liver,  and lean animal proteins which supply other essential key brain nutrients such as omega 3, creatine, Coq10, and taurine.  
The BRAIN Diet adheres to international nutritional intake guidelines while allowing for personalisation based on other complementary individual goals besides brain health, such as building muscle mass, gut healing, food sensitivities or intolerances, or aligning with ethical and environmental values.
This is a food-first baseline designed to modulate key biological systems commonly disrupted in ADHD, depression, cognitive decline, and other neurocognitive disorders. The dietary plan is plant leaning but with some targets only found in animal vegetarians/vegans may benefit with some fortification or targeted supplementation, which we note explicitly where relevant. While inspired by the Mediterranean diet’s strengths in cardiometabolic health, the BRAIN Diet advances this model by incorporating:
•	Neurotransmitter precursor support (e.g., tyrosine, tryptophan, choline, DHA)
•	Circadian-alignment , protein-rich breakfasts,cicradian alinged neurotransmitter targetting 
•	Food matrix strategies to improve micronutrient synergy and bioavailability
•	Psychobiotic and polyphenol-rich foods for gut-brain axis regulation
•	Mitochondrial support and methylation pathway modulation (ATP energy precursors)
•	HPA Axis and ANS regulation (Insulin control, hormone regulation)
•	Methylation Support

Mechanistic Cascades 
Throughout this review, we use a standardized “mechanistic cascade” format to summarize key dietary and biological pathways relevant to ADHD. Each cascade is presented in diagram and written form by a sequence of causal steps. This structure enables clear visualization of hypothesized intervention pathways and facilitates identification of testable targets for future research and key dietary targets.
Dietary Framework
The Framework which supports the BRAIN diet is depicted below (Figure 2). This paper focuses primarily on the research relating to the subjects under the “Food Matrix”,  “Food Components” “Biological Targets” , “Detox agents” and “Preparation Science”. However, the sourcing, the ethics and the mindful eating strategies as represented in the framework are all essential elements that would contribute towards treating food as a legitimate, medical-grade intervention, they are just not the direct scope of this paper.

 
Figure 2 – Overview of BRAIN dietary framework.  
Many of the biological mechanisms discussed below, such as gut microbiome composition, gut-brain axis dynamics, and neurotransmitter regulation, are still emerging fields. They require further exploration through larger, more nuanced human studies to strengthen their clinical relevance, but some positive human studies exist and much preclinical research indicates dietary interventions could be highly beneficial, particularly when employed in aggregate with systems wide targeted dietary support presented within this paper.
2.	Food Matrix Interactions
The ‘food matrix’ is the integrated physical and chemical environment in which nutrients and bioactives exist, influencing digestion, absorption, and biological effect This perspective moves beyond reductionist nutrient counting to a systems-based view of whole foods, preparation methods, and synergistic pairings.  (Fardet and Rock 2015). It factors in the complex physical and chemical environment in which nutrients and bioactives exist including knowledge of the interaction of foods, particularly whole foods, as part of a meal, and those synergies and interactions which are introduced when eating foods together, and including the science of  food preparation and cooking, and the resulting biologic interactions and metabolic outcomes. 
This systems view is especially relevant in ADHD, where seemingly small shifts in micronutrient status and metabolic regulation can have disproportionate effects on cognitive and behavioral outcomes. Throughout this paper, we highlight key nutrient-affected biological and behavioral cascades that illustrate these interactions. A classic milestone study by (Haber et al. 1977) demonstrated that apple juice induces a substantially greater postprandial insulin spike and lower satiety compared to either apple purée or the intact fruit, underscoring the role of food structure in metabolic responses. More recent work has extended these observations to the brain, linking attenuated glycemic excursions from intact food matrices to preserved brain insulin sensitivity, improved dopaminergic regulation, and more balanced reward processing (Gruber et al. 2023) This example illustrates how a seemingly simple dietary variable like food structure, can trigger many metabolic and neurobehavioral effects relevant to ADHD.
Cascade  2.1. Whole Food Structure and Insulin Response
 
Cascade Catpion  2.1 - Preserving natural food structure (e.g., an apple vs. processed forms) blunts post-prandial glycemic excursions, supports brain insulin sensitivity, and stabilizes dopamine–insulin coupling, mechanisms that may help regulate motivation and reduce impulsive behaviors. (See (Haber et al. 1977) (Gruber et al. 2023).
The food matrix also factors in how the body processes those nutrients, including:
•	Bioaccessibility (Auer et al. 2024)(Auer et al. 2024) (what’s released during digestion) ; will depend on antinutrients, cell wall structure(Holland et al. 2020), preparation method i.e. sprouting, soaking, manufacturing i.e. roasting, cleaving etc(Opazo-Navarrete et al. 2025) (Opazo-Navarrete et al. 2025). 
•	Bioavailability (what’s actually absorbed into the bloodstream). 
•	Biotransformation (what results from digestion) . The gut microbiome produces an array of highly beneficial compounds.   Not all gut biomes produce the same metabolites however, Urolithin A, a powerful antioxidant (Singh et al. 2022) (Singh et al. 2022) was more successfully produced with those with increased gut biota Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio. 

The State of Bioavailability Information
In nutritional therapy it is essential to maximise nutrient bioavailability through strategic food combinations, particularly for individuals with ADHD, where micronutrient status often plays a role in symptom modulation. While complete food matrix interactions and synergistic bioavailability effects remain largely un-mapped (Melse-Boonstra 2020) existing literature provides key foundational estimates from which real nutritional advantages can be gained (Gibson 2007). While food labeling systems may not yet account for these variables, emerging nutritional science offers enough insight to strategically design diets that harness matrix effects for improved metabolic and cognitive outcomes.
Food Preparation in managing harmful and healthful byproducts
Knowledge driven preparation of food is essential in creating clinical grade meals where nutrients are preserved, including antioxidants, and antinutrients are reduced (phytates, lectins, oxalates, tannins)  and harmful food byproducts i.e. those crated through excessive heat and oxidation, are avoided. 
Oxidation End Products
Oxidation end products are reactive compounds formed when fats, proteins, and carbohydrates undergo heat- or oxidation-driven chemical changes during cooking and storage; their accumulation can disrupt cellular function and has been linked to metabolic, cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative disorders. There are also a set of antinutrients which can be stategically reduced via preparation methods, we outline some of the key examples below.  
The Malliard Reaction 
One of the most well known, particulary by chefs, is the malliard reaction. This is the surface browning seen on food when heated sugars oxidise with amino acids, it  can be used as a visual mechanic to highlight when food reaches a damaging level of cooking.  The malliard properties ( or Maillard reaction products (MRPs) of some foods actually have antioxidant properties though this is more common in carbohydrate high foods, breads etc, not so much in meats, unless sugar containing marinades are used. 
MRPs possess excellent antioxidant ability in many food products, through chelation of metal ions, breakdown of radical chains and hydrogen peroxide, and scavenging of reactive oxygen species(Nooshkam, Varidi, and Bashash 2019).  There is a point which needs to be avoided through precise cooking so antioxidants don’t  break down and harmful byproducts don’t appear such as acrylamide and heterocyclic amine  HCAs and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons PAHs(Edna Hee et al. 2024).  
Antinutrients
In the context of a diverse, well-prepared diet, antinutrients such as phytates, oxalates, lectins, and tannins rarely pose a threat to nutrient status or cognitive health. In fact, many of these compounds have dual roles, with emerging evidence pointing to health-protective properties such as antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. 
Unless a person has specific risk factors (e.g. mineral deficiency, kidney stones, gut permeability), there's little evidence that dietary antinutrients cause harm. However phytates can bind essential minerals such as zinc, iron, and calcium, potentially impairing their absorption,  they can also exhibit antioxidant properties, and have been associated with reduced risk of kidney stones and some cancers (Taylor et al. 2009) . In maize, for example, 80 h of germination reduced phytate content by 31.9 %, and 96 h of malting achieved a 45.3 % reduction(Nsabimana et al. 2024). Fermentation goes further: lactic acid bacteria acidify the medium, activating microbial and endogenous phytases (Pivac et al. 2011) (Lopez et al., 2001; De Angelis et al., 2003), while also increasing B-vitamin levels(LeBlanc et al. 2011), producing beneficial organic acids, and partially pre-digesting starch and protein—improving both digestibility and glycaemic response (Katina et al., 2005; LeBlanc et al., 2011; Scazzina et al., 2009).

Cascade 2.2 — Preparation method & neurotransmitter synthesis. 


 

Cascade Caption 2.2 - Sprouting, soaking, and boiling reduce antinutrients, improving mineral bioavailability (e.g., zinc, iron etc) that serve as cofactors for dopamine and serotonin pathways, supporting neurotransmitter synthesis. (Greiner & Konietzny, 1999)

Cascade 2.3 — Cooking intensity, AGEs & synaptic plasticity. 
 
Higher cooking temperature/time increases Maillard products/AGEs, elevating oxidative stress and microglial activation, which reduces synaptic plasticity. Favoring gentler cooking methods to limit AGE formation can better preserve neuronal function. (Uribarri et al., 2010).

Cascade 2.4 — Matrix Synergy & Nutrient Absorption
 
The bioaccessibility of carotenoids in vegetables is remarkably low , only 1-3% of the β-carotene in raw carrots is accessible for absorption and  lycopene in canned and fresh tomatoes is <1%. (Fielding et al. 2005)Co-consuming a small amount of unsaturated fat with polyphenol-rich foods improves micelle formation and chylomicron packaging(Kindel et al. 2010), increasing carotenoid and fat-soluble vitamin (A, D, E, K) absorption. This, in turn, reinforces antioxidant defenses and membrane fluidity, supporting stable neuronal signaling. Practical pairings: spinach + eggs, tomatoes + olive oil, salad + oil .(Brown et al. 2004), carrots + tahini, kale + avocado, berries + yogurt/nuts. 


3.	Micronutrients and Nutrient-Dense Foods for Brain Health

Vitamins and minerals function as indispensable micronutrients and enzymatic cofactors in all pivotal brain biology pathways, aiding neurotransmitter synthesis, mitochondrial energy production, DNA repair, antioxidant defense, methylation, and the regulation of neuroplasticity (Tardy et al. 2020) with B-vitamins playing a central role (Kennedy 2016). Their availability can determine whether compounds such as omega-3 fatty acids, polyphenols, or amino acid precursors exert their intended effects. This interdependence highlights the importance of viewing nutrition as an interdependent system.

For a wide array of vitamins and minerals research suggests that increased adherence to the Mediterranean diet is effective in targeting essential vitamins and minerals, due to the wide array of fruits, vegtables, and healthy fats (Castro-Quezada, Román-Viñas, and Serra-Majem 2014) .  


Reccomended Daily Amounts and Revisions

While RDAs guide population-wide intake, emerging evidence suggests that brain health may require higher intakes of certain water-soluble vitamins, especially B-complex vitamins, closer to tolerable upper limits (Kennedy 2016)(Kennedy 2016) . While the brain employs selective transporters at the blood-brain barrier (Harrison and May 2009),which prioritize retention and protect against short-term dietary fluctuations, (Sugandhi et al., 2024) this resovoir effect has mainly been isolated in animal models which point towards similar sophisticated dynamics in human(Tiani et al. 2019). Besides that , some vitamins, such as thiamine, turn over rapidly and may require more consistent intake to not create dangerous deficiencies.  
Micronutrient Supplementation for ADHD 

Research indicates that deficiencies in vitamins and minerals essential for methylation, such as folate, vitamin B12, and zinc, are correlated to ADHD symptoms and that supplementing these micronutrients has shown potential in supporting methylation and reducing symptom severity (Razavinia et al. 2024) . Other common deficiencies, particularly linked with children, are iodine and iron (“WHO Micronutrient Deficiencies” 2025). A large Australian cohort study, discussed in the review by (Millichap and Yee 2012)found that dietary patterns rich in fibre, folate, and omega-3 fatty acids were associated with reduced ADHD symptoms.

Nutrient Density 
Nutrient density is a central premise of the BRAIN Diet. This includes not only meeting daily needs but selecting foods for their bioactive potential: extra virgin olive oil for polyphenols, kimchi and kefir  give microbiome support, or salmon and other roe for phospholipid-bound omega-3s and algal DHA for plant-based eaters.
As we discussed above ‘section 2 food matrix’, the full power of nutrient-network effects depends on the consistent availability of key dietary precursors and synergistic nutrients. Whether it’s supporting a diverse gut microbiome, network polyphenol interactions, a broad spectrum of vitamins and minerals, optimal amino acid profiles from plant and/or animal sources, or balanced omega-3 to omega-6 ratios, all of these inter-related nutrients can only work when highly nutritional food targets that provide these cofactors and precurors are regularly provided. 
The implementation of the BRAIN diet must go beyond a standard nutrient density focus, it's about choosing foods for their specific bioactive potential: early harvest extra virgin olive oil with higher levels of CoQ10, oleuropein and polyphenols, grass-fed liver for bioavailable retinol and B12, mucuna beans for natural LDOPA(Gasmi et al. 2022), traditionally fermented breads that optimize Maillard Reaction Products (MRPs) , or cooled grains , fish roe for phospholipid bound omega 3 or algal oil for vegetarians etc .
While the BRAIN Diet should encourage regular consumption of oily fish to meet baseline omega-3 requirements (~250–500 mg/day EPA+DHA), in line with EFSA guidelines. Beyond this, targeted foods such as salmon or lumpfish roe can be used to reliably and safely exceed minimum intakes, helping individuals achieve optimal omega-3 status for brain health, cognitive performance, and inflammatory regulation. This precision approach mirrors therapeutic ranges observed in neurocognitive research, without resorting to high-dose supplementation. 
Beverages (micronutrient-focused)

Each dietary window is an opportunity to make strategic beverage choices that contribute vitamins/minerals and modulate absorption. Mineral or well-mineralized water can provide meaningful magnesium, calcium, bicarbonate, and trace elements; where tap water is filtered, re-mineralization helps restore electrolyte balance. Natural waters sometimes contain trace lithium; amounts are typically low but may be relevant for ADHD individuals (see section 7.6 )).
Green tea contributes manganese and small amounts of fluoride and potassium, alongside polyphenols that support antioxidant defenses. Masala/“chai” , tumeric milk are great sources where biocative brain focused herbs are present (see section 10.2) . Fortified plant milks and dairy milk can help meet calcium (and sometimes iodine, depending on fortification and local practices) targets when used judiciously.
Absorption note: Polyphenol-rich beverages (tea/coffee) can reduce non-heme iron absorption if taken with iron-rich plant meals; spacing them ≥1 hour away or adding vitamin-C sources (e.g., lemon) favors iron uptake.
Closing the Vegan Nutrient Target Gaps
While the BRAIN Diet emphasizes food synergy and systems biology over isolated supplementation, vegan versions of the protocol must address key nutrients that are rarely adequate through vegan whole foods alone. These include vitamin B12, DHA/EPA, choline, taurine, carnosine, creatine, and bioavailable iron and zinc. 
Precision sourcing of functional plant foods such as Mankai duckweed (iron, B12), soy/soy lecithin (choline), and fortified nutritional yeast (B12, B6) helps narrow vegan nutrient gaps. Microalgae provide DHA, typically in triglyceride form; vegans should ensure adequate choline intake (e.g., soy or sunflower lecithin, soy foods, quinoa, broccoli) to support phosphatidylcholine synthesis and downstream LPC-DHA transport for brain delivery (see Section 3.1).
Chlorella contains bioavailable, true vitamin B12 (cobalamin), confirmed in animal feeding trials, and may help close vegan nutrient gaps. By contrast, spirulina is dominated by pseudovitamin B12 analogues, which are inactive in humans and therefore unsuitable as a primary B12 source (Watanabe et al. 2002) (Watanabe et al. 2002). Nonetheless, both algae provide antioxidant and amino acid support.
Where food alone cannot achieve sufficiency, strategic supplementation is justified. Essential nutrients such as methylcobalamin and iron (especially in forms with higher bioavailability, such as liposomal iron) must be prioritized to prevent deficiency and support cognitive health. Beyond these, conditionally beneficial compounds such as creatine monohydrate and taurine may further help maintain neurochemical and metabolic balance.

4.	Protein & Amino Acid Sources – ‘Neuronutrition Core’
While micronutrients set the enzymatic processes driving brain health, it is the careful balance of the macronutrients, protein, fats, and carbohydrates, that must work in harmony with our circadian rhythms. Together, they regulate the key biological systems that shape everything from brain energy and inflammation to cognition and mood.
Protein, one of the three primary macronutrients alongside fats and carbohydrates, is perhaps the most debated area of nutrition. Its nuances span quality, source, frequency, digestibility, and recommended intakes, all of which vary depending on the goal, be it longevity, muscle retention, metabolic health, or, in the case of this paper, brain health.
The BRAIN Diet must account for these variables while ensuring that nutrition meets brain-specific nutrient targets. This includes recognising that several brain-relevant nutrients are predominantly or exclusively found in animal-sourced proteins, such as creatine, taurine, Coenzyme Q10 (also in smaller amounts in olive oil; (Zmitek, Rodríguez-Aguilera, and Pravst 2014)), and vitamin B₁₂ (also present in Wolffia globosa; (Kaplan et al. 2019)). Achieving the right balance between plant and animal proteins is therefore essential, both for nutritional adequacy and for ensuring the diet remains sustainable, inclusive, and neurologically effective over the long term.
Protein requirements are context-dependent: age, activity level, health goals, and personal values all influence optimal intake. While general recommendations sit at around 0.83 g/kg/day (“Scientific Opinion on Dietary Reference Values for Protein,” 2012), a meta-analysis (Tagawa et al. 2021)  showed dose–response relationship between protein intake and muscle mass increase: the rate of increase in the effect of protein supplementation rapidly diminished after 1.3 g/kg BW/d was exceeded, while resistance training was found to markedly attenuate this decline. More recent work ((Trommelen et al. 2023) ) indicates that protein consumed in larger boluses can maintain positive whole-body protein balance over several hours, suggesting some flexibility in distribution. 
Achieving the right balance between plant and animal protein sources is essential not only for nutritional adequacy, but also for ensuring that the BRAIN Diet remains sustainable, inclusive, and neurologically effective over the long term.

4.1 Balancing animal and plants for brain health
While observational studies frequently link vegetarianism with reduced chronic disease risk, the relationship between diet type and brain health is more nuanced. Significant research gaps remain, but existing research indicates truly optimal brain-focused nutrition may require a more strategic approach that combines plant-based diversity with targeted animal-derived nutrients.
A recent Taiwanese cohort (J.-H. Tsai et al. 2022)) of 5,710 adults found that vegetarians had a 33% lower risk of dementia compared to non-vegetarians. Similarly, Mediterranean dietary patterns have shown neuroprotective effects, reducing dementia risk between 22–33% ((Shannon et al. 2023)), even after correcting for genetic risk. Epidemiological data do not indicate that excluding all animal foods is necessary for longevity, but rather that plant-forward diets, such as the Mediterranean, often include modest amounts of dairy, fish, and meat, which are common denominators in Blue Zones (Buettner and Skemp 2016).
Conversely, several studies highlight nutrient shortfalls in fully plant-based diets that may undermine cognitive resilience. (Katonova et al. 2022)) note that while vegan diets are low in saturated fats and cholesterol and rich in antioxidants and fibre, they can lack vitamin B12, vitamin D, DHA, and certain minerals, all of which are critical for brain health. Supporting this concern, (Jigeer et al. 2025)) found that vegetarians in their 80s had higher odds of cognitive impairment compared to omnivores, likely due to deficiencies in B12, EPA/DHA, and zinc.
Evidence also suggests that some degree of seafood intake may be necessary for optimal cognitive outcomes. In a two-year follow-up of Dutch older adults, (van Soest et al. 2023) found that adherence to a healthful plant-based diet did not improve cognition or slow decline unless participants consumed at least one weekly portion of fish. This aligns with MIND diet research, where high polyphenol intake (leafy greens, berries) combined with key animal-derived nutrients produced measurable neuroprotective effects (. (van den Brink et al. 2019; Agarwal et al. 2023).).
The BRAIN Diet is designed to capture these dual benefits, leveraging abundant plant foods for antioxidants, polyphenols, and fibre, while strategically including animal-derived sources of CoQ10, creatine, taurine, and omega-3 fatty acids. For omnivores, this means leaning toward a predominantly plant-based pattern with purposeful selection of animal proteins. For plant-based eaters, it involves optimising brain health through a wide variety of nutrient-dense foods and supplementing where dietary gaps are hard to fill.
Table X (below) compares the contribution of key brain-health nutrients which are normally predominantly available from animal sources, highlighting why the BRAIN Diet incorporates both plant-forward diversity and targeted inclusion of animal proteins or equivalent supplementation.

Nutrient	Primary Role in Brain Health	Top Animal Sources (DIAAS ≥100 where possible)	Top Plant / Vegan Sources	Notes on Deficiency Risk in Vegan Diets
Creatine	Supports ATP recycling in neurons; enhances working memory and cognitive processing speed	Beef, lamb, pork, salmon, tuna, cod, scallops	Minimal — trace amounts in seaweed (e.g., nori) [CITATION NEEDED: study showing creatine content in nori/seaweed]	Vegan diets lack creatine; supplementation or fortified foods may be needed [CITATION NEEDED: study on creatine levels in vegetarians/vegans]
Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10)	Mitochondrial electron transport; antioxidant protection for neurons	Organ meats (heart, liver), oily fish (sardines, mackerel), beef	Spinach, broccoli, pistachios, olive oil (lower amounts)	Plant forms (ubiquinone) less concentrated; deficiency risk higher with age
Taurine	Regulates calcium signalling, antioxidant defence, and neurotransmission	Scallops, clams, dark-meat poultry, mackerel	Minimal in plants; trace in seaweed/algae	Deficiency risk for vegans; brain taurine levels tied to neuroprotection
EPA & DHA (Omega-3)	Anti-inflammatory; membrane fluidity; neurotransmitter receptor function	Sardines, mackerel, salmon, tuna, cod liver	Algal oil (direct DHA), seaweed (low bioavailable DHA/EPA)	Conversion from ALA is <5% in most adults; direct DHA/EPA strongly recommended
Vitamin B12	Myelin synthesis, methylation, neurotransmitter production	Liver, clams, fish, eggs, dairy	Fortified plant milks, nutritional yeast, supplements	Deficiency causes cognitive decline, mood disorders, neuropathy
Carnosine	Antioxidant, pH buffer, protects neurons from glycation and oxidative damage	Beef, pork, chicken	None	Absent in vegan diets; synthesised from histidine + beta-alanine, but beta-alanine mostly from animal food
Zinc	Neurotransmitter modulation, synaptic plasticity, antioxidant enzymes	Oysters, beef, crab, chicken, pork	Pumpkin seeds, lentils, chickpeas, cashews	Plant zinc less bioavailable due to phytates; soaking/sprouting helps
Iron(heme & non-heme)	Oxygen delivery to brain, dopamine synthesis	Liver, beef, lamb, poultry, fish	Lentils, spinach, tofu, pumpkin seeds	Heme iron from animal sources is 2–3× more bioavailable

Table X - key brain-health nutrients which are normally predominantly available from animal sources
Iron  - is an essential cofactor for tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the conversion of tyrosine to dopamine (Beard et al., 2003; Erikson et al., 2000. Pairing plant-based iron sources with citrus (Hallberg et al. 1989)  fat-soluble vitamins with avocado or olive oil, or spreading minerals across meals are simple but impactful strategies that support maximising dietary nutrition. 

4.2 Animal and Plant Based Protein Balance examples
While most animal proteins provide all nine essential amino acids in optimal ratios, plant proteins require strategic pairing.(Mariotti and Gardner 2019) (Mariotti and Gardner 2019)(Cascade 4.1 below) Many plants are often low in methionine and lysine so combinations such as grains or pseudograins with legumes can be essential for vegetarians.  
Cascade 4.2 Grain–legume complementarity. 

 
Cascade 4.2 Caption - Grain–legume complementarity. Grains (typically lysine-limited) and legumes (methionine/cysteine-limited) complete each other’s profiles when paired, improving essential amino-acid coverage and supporting precursor sufficiency for tyrosine and tryptophan. 
4.3 Neurochemical Overview
Neurochemicals are molecules that are responsible for communication between nerve cells, and nerve cells and other cells.  They are typically classified based on their function which can be excitatory, inhibitory or modulatory in nature, although some neurochemicals can have multiple functions.  Neurotransmitters can also be classified chemically as either amino acids, monoamines, purines, etc.  

Neurotransmitter imbalances and Dopamine’s wider implications
Many neurological disorders are thought to be due to neurochemical imbalances although conclusive proof is often lacking. (Akyuz et al. 2025) and much research has now implicated much broader neurotransmitter dysregulation. A meta study analysis  (MacDonald et al. 2024) concluded that while dopaminergic dysfunction is consistently linked to ADHD, evidence does not support a simple global hypo-dopaminergic model and that dopamine alterations vary by ADHD subtypes, developmental stage, and brain region, interacting with other neurotransmitter systems. (Perreault et al. 2014) noted the difficulties in really ‘disentangling’ pure dopaminergic neurotransmission from other transmitter systems; >200 chemical messengers (classical transmitters, neuropeptides, purines, lipid mediators, gases) have been described, underscoring the system’s complexity(Gasmi et al. 2022).  This is why the BRAIN Diet must target broad neurochemical precursors and cofactors to support efficient neurotransmitter production. 
Many neurological disorders are associated with neurochemical imbalances, although direct causal proof is often limited (Akyuz et al., 2025). Increasingly, evidence points toward broader neurotransmitter dysregulation rather than single-system deficits. A meta-analysis by MacDonald et al. (2024) concluded that while dopaminergic dysfunction is consistently linked to ADHD, the data do not support a simple global hypo-dopaminergic model. Instead, dopamine alterations vary by ADHD subtype, developmental stage, and brain region, and frequently interact with other neurotransmitter systems. As Perreault et al. (2014) note, disentangling “pure” dopaminergic signalling from the influence of other transmitters remains a significant challenge.
For these reasons, the diet must target a broad spectrum of neurochemical precursors, while also integrating anti-inflammatory nutrients and gut–brain modulators i.e.  to support balanced neurotransmitter production across systems—not dopamine alone. This approach aligns with dietary intervention research showing that nutrient patterns rich in amino acid precursors, omega-3 fatty acids, and polyphenols can influence dopamine, serotonin, GABA, and acetylcholine pathways simultaneously, supporting mood stability, attention, and cognitive performance.
4.4 Default Mode Network (DMN) and Dopamine

Dopamine affects ADHD both as a crucial neurotransmitter involved in regulating attention, and executive functions and also as a neuromodulator affecting broader neural networks such as the Default Mode Network (DMN). The DMN are regions of the brain that are active during non-focused activity such as daydreaming.  The inability to move from a DMN state to an executive state has been hypothesized as one of the causes of ADHD.  Over time, this neural inefficiency contributes to mental fatigue (Section 8. Metabolic Dysregulation)  and susceptibility to burnout, consistent with reports of attentional exhaustion in ADHD populations.  Dopamine dysregulation in ADHD impairs the brain’s ability to shift from rest-state (DMN) to focus-state networks. The BRAIN Diet uses nutrient-timed meals to support this transition through dopamine precursors and anti-inflammatory nutrients to reduce DMN dysregulation(Marsland et al. 2017).   A meta-analysis has also shown that amphetamine based medications consistently (11 of 12 studies) restored connectivity in DMN areas(Santos et al. 2019). 


4.5 Dopamine food strategies
 
Individuals targeting dopamine via fatty and sugary foods is common in ADHD populations which is probably correlated to the double dopamine reward(Thanarajah et al. 2019) experienced when eating food. These orosensory and post-ingestion dopamine circuits and reward systems can be utilised as dietary strategies   (Table 3 below)., they must be used sparingly as we discuss below eating is the best strategy when the body needs nutrition, at other times other interventions are available such as exercise or meditation. 



Strategy	Rationale	Application in BRAIN Diet
Use sensory-rich, but nutrient-dense meals	Stimulate first dopamine release without junk food	Visual appeal, aroma, textures (e.g. colorful smoothie bowls, herbed protein dishes)
Ensure real nutrient delivery for the second peak	Reinforce positive reward loop through actual nutrition	Meals rich in tyrosine, omega-3s, magnesium, slow carbs
Time meals to align with cognitive demands	Harness reward-motivation boost around task performance	Morning and midday meals structured for work/school focus
Build habit loops around consistent foods	Condition dopamine response to healthy eating routines	Repeat satisfying meals at predictable times for brain entrainment
Avoid ultra-processed foods	These hijack the double dopamine system and lead to dysregulation and addictive behaviours(LaFata et al. 2024)
Emphasize whole foods and minimize synthetic flavors/sweeteners

Table 3. – Dopamine reward dietary strategies

Glutamate is the principal excitatory neurotransmitter of the central nervous system and the most abundant neurotransmitter in the brain (Zhou and Danbolt 2014).    Dysregulation of glutamatergic signaling has widespread clinical relevance and is strongly implicated in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), including treatment-resistant subtypes (Khoodoruth et al. 2022)(Khoodoruth et al., 2022). Given the limitations of prevailing monoamine hypothesis-based pharmacotherapy, glutamate and glutamatergic-related pathways may offer both alternative and complementary targets for intervention. Low levels of glutamate in a number of critical brain areas correlated with low scores on the Barkley attention scale (Maltezos et al. 2014) adding to the hypothesis that ADHD may involve broader disturbances in excitatory neurotransmission than dopaminergic dysfunction.￼We discuss below how dietary phytochemicals such as genistein and omega-3s, may help restore neurochemical homeostasis including dopamine and glutamate. 


Norepinephrine, also known as noradrenaline, plays a significant role in attention, arousal, and the modulation of executive functions. Alterations in norepinephrine signaling have been associated with ADHD (O’Donnell et al. 2012), affecting the regulation of attention and response inhibition. The physiological changes induced by the binding of norepinephrine to its receptors involve the modulation of several cognitive and executive processes usually impaired in ADHD, supporting the monoaminergic hypothesis for ADHD pathophysiology. 

Serotonin is involved in mood regulation, emotional processing, and impulse control. Reduced levels of serotonin may contribute to the development of ADHD, influencing hyperactive and impulsive components of ADHD but perhaps not inattention (Banerjee and Nandagopal 2015). The involvement of serotonin in ADHD is supported by findings that reduced levels of the neurotransmitter may contribute to the disorder along with several genetic markers(Oades 2010). Identifying specific neurotransmitter interplay with ADHD is confounded by the many comorbidities of ADHD where more than 80 percent may exhibit co-morbid psychiatric problems and over half express symptoms satisfying two or more co-morbid disorders (Cumyn, French, and Hechtman 2009).

4.5 Emotional Dysregulation and ADHD
Emotional dysregulation (ED) is also a major factor of ADHD with a growing body of research recognizing emotional dysregulation as a core but underacknowledged component of the condition, estimates suggest that 25–45% of children and 30–70% of adults have this comorbidity(Shaw et al. 2014) (Shaw et al. 2014) . 
Oxytocin levels have also been implicated in ADHD study subjects correlating to clinically significant emotional dysregulation, including, aggression, and impaired empathy(Hwang et al. 2024). 
Neurobiologically, ED overlaps extensively with pathways implicated in stress reactivity, limbic overactivation, dopaminergic tone, and inflammation. Many of the nutritional strategies discussed in this paper—such as glycemic stabilization, SCFA production, polyphenol intake, and anxiolytic probiotic interventions—are expected to exert downstream effects on emotional regulation through modulation of HPA axis activity, limbic signalling, and neurotransmitter systems. Although ED is not treated as a separate section, it is functionally embedded across multiple dietary cascades, particularly those targeting anxiety, stress, and vagal signalling.
Converging evidence indicates that emotion dysregulation is a transdiagnostic construct observed across multiple psychiatric and neurologic conditions. In ADHD, ED correlates with symptom severity, executive-function deficits, and functional impairment, and may represent a core dimension for a substantial subset of adults. However, ED is not unique to ADHD; overlapping fronto-limbic circuitry, stress-axis dynamics, reward/salience signaling, sleep–circadian disruption, and inflammatory tone likely account for the symptom overlap with disorders such as mood and anxiety disorders, PTSD, autism spectrum, and borderline personality disorder. This suggests ED reflects brain systems under load rather than a single disorder-specific phenomenon, strengthening the case for dimensional, mechanism-focused interventions (behavioral, sleep/circadian, metabolic, anti-inflammatory, and psychopharmacologic).
Rejection sensitivity dysphoria is also a transdiagnostic construct observed across multiple psychiatric and neurologic conditions which manifests as heightened sensitivity to perceived rejection. Empirical work on rejection sensitivity demonstrates broad, transdiagnostic expression across mood, anxiety, trauma-related, personality, and neurodevelopmental disorders, consistent with shared fronto-limbic hyperreactivity and stress-axis dysregulation. Within ADHD, this phenotype likely reflects the intersection of emotion dysregulation, negative prediction bias, and social-threat salience rather than a disorder-specific entity.
4.6 Key Mood and Cognition Neurotransmitters 

Below we summarise the key neurotransmitters implicated in cognition, mood  and ADHD symptoms and their key precursors and cofactors.



Neuro¬chemical	Primary Role(s)	Key Precursors / Cofactors	Best BRAIN Diet Food Sources	Timing / Synergy Notes
Glutamate	Principal excitatory neurotransmitter; learning, memory, cognition and mood deficits 	Glutamine (from protein), B6, magnesium, zinc	Lentils, poultry, fish, spinach, pumpkin seeds	Maintain magnesium & antioxidant intake to prevent excitotoxicity; balance with GABA-supporting foods in evening
Dopamine	Attention, motivation, executive function; DMN-to-task switching	Tyrosine, phenylalanine; iron, B6, folate, omega-3s	Lean poultry, beef, fish, dairy, soy, pumpkin seeds; omega-3 rich fish	Protein-rich breakfasts; pair with anti-inflammatory nutrients to protect DMN switching; avoid chronic over-reward from ultra-processed foods
Norepinephrine	Attention, arousal, executive modulation	Tyrosine, phenylalanine; vitamin C, copper	Same as dopamine sources + citrus, bell peppers (vitamin C)	Morning/midday higher-protein meals to support focus; avoid excessive stimulants late day
Serotonin	Mood regulation, emotional control, impulse moderation	Tryptophan; B6, magnesium; carb co-ingestion to aid LAT1 transport	Turkey, eggs, dairy, soy, seeds, oats, bananas	Pair tryptophan-rich proteins with moderate carbs to increase Trp:LNAA ratio; timing midday or evening for calming effect
GABA	Main inhibitory neurotransmitter; calms neural activity, supports sleep	Glutamate (from protein), B6, Magnesium functions as an NMDA receptor antagonist and GABA receptor modulator ((Clerc et al. 2013)),  Zinc – acts as an allosteric modulator of the GABA receptor ((Peralta and Huidobro-Toro 2016));).
	Green tea, fermented foods, polyphenols (genistein)spinach, almonds, pumpkin seeds	Increase intake later in day; combine with relaxation rituals for circadian alignment
Acetylcholine and choline	Memory, learning, neuroplasticity	Choline, acetyl-CoA	Egg yolks, fish roe, soy, wheat germ, liver	Regular choline intake supports ongoing synthesis; important for structural membrane health
BDNF(modulator)	Neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, mood resilience	Omega-3s, polyphenols, exercise	Fatty fish, blueberries, turmeric, green tea, walnuts	Exercise + omega-3 + polyphenol synergy boosts expression; anti-inflammatory diet helps sustain levels
Oxytocin(modulator)	Social bonding, trust, emotional buffering	Indirect (via gut–vagus axis, social cues)	Fermented foods, magnesium-rich foods, foods supporting dopamine & serotonin	Mindful shared meals, probiotic-rich foods, stress reduction; benefits from healthy dopamine tone

 
Table X – Summary of ADHD implicated Neurochemicals
4.7 Vitamin B6 Activation in the Brain

B6 is a cofactor in the development of all the key neurotransmitters presented above (Table X). Only once pyridoxine (PIN), pyridoxal (PAL), pyridoxamine (PAM) (Spector 1978)cross the blood–brain barrier in their non-phosphorylated forms, can they be converted into pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP or P5P), the active coenzyme form. This means that systemic supplementation with PLP does not bypass the brain’s reliance on its own enzymatic machinery. Instead, they require pyridoxal kinase (PDXK)  activity, which is supported by cofactors such as magnesium and ATP. 

In ADHD, genetic variations and enzymatic inefficiencies may influence PDXK activity and thus PLP availability, potentially impairing neurotransmitter synthesis. Clinical evidence supports this: combined B6 and magnesium supplementation has been reported to reduce inattention and hyperactivity(M Mousain-Bosc 1 2006) (Mousain-Bosc et al., 2006). Since plant-based diets provide less bioavailable B6, deficiencies are more common in vegan and older populations (Waldmann et al. 2006) (Wilson et al. 2019) researched b6 deficiencies and found celiac disease, alcoholism and genetic mutations can lead to very poor absorption and deficiency leading to serious brain injury and epilepsy.
4.8	Key Neurotransmitter Strategies

Tryptophan, a serotonin precursor, has been linked to reduced anxiety, improved mood, and lower depressive symptoms (Aquili, 2020a), but shows very limited benefit for ADHD symptoms (Dinu et al., 2023). Its entry into the brain occurs via the LAT1 transporter and competes with other large neutral amino acids (LNAAs) (tyrosine, phenylalanine, leucine, isoleucine, valine).
Carbohydrate-rich, low-protein meals raise the plasma tryptophan:LNAA ratio, because insulin pushes the competing LNAAs out to muscles, lowering competing LNAAs in plasma, thereby reducing competition at the BBB In a crossover breakfast study (Wurtman et al. 2003) (Wurtman et al. 2003):
•	Compared to the high protein breakfast, the high carbohydrate low protein breakfast raised the tryptophan:LNAA ratio by a median ~54% (range ~36–88%).
•	Compared to the high carbohydrate breakfast, the high protein breakfast raised the tyrosine:LNAA ratio by a median ~28%(range ~10–64%).

 
Figure 3 –Figure 3 – Increasing Tyr + Trp over LAT1 with Carb loading

 
Carbohydrate type also matters: sucrose produced a larger rise in tryptophan:LNAA (+34%) than starch (+20%), consistent with higher-GI carbohydrates more strongly enhancing brain tryptophan bioavailability (Lyons and Truswell 1988)(Lyons and Truswell 1988)).

Cascade 4.8.1 -  LAT1 competition: meal design for serotonin or dopamine
 
Cascade Caption 4.8.1 – (As discussed above section 4.8)  Moderate carbohydrate intake reduces competition at the LAT1 transporter. Crucially, both pathways and their respective enzymes rely on the Cofactors (iron, B6, folate, omega-3s and BH₄(tetrahydrobiopterin)(Fanet et al. 2021)) to support the rate-limiting steps in catecholamine synthesis. These nutrients, along with omega-3 fatty acids also support LAT1 transport, membrane fluidity and neurotransmitter production.
While no human dietary nutrition trial has definitively tested whether bolstering BH₄ via vitamins, antioxidants or cofactors enhances TH/AADC activity in healthy individuals, the biochemical and animal evidence justifies its inclusion as a mechanistic node in our framework.(Kurosaki et al. 2019)

Tyrosine may enhance working memory performance in healthy older adults, potentially through modulating functional connectivity in brain regions associated with cognitive control (Hensel et al. 2019)..Meta analysis of L-tyrosine have shown efficacy in some studies; other small studies suggested a quick tolerance after limited efficacy of only 2 weeks (F W Reimherr and M Ward 1987) suggesting that extra tyrosine will not fix a dopamine dysregulation problem and moreover that dopamine dysregulation is not the only ADHD problem.  
BDNF - Low levels of BDNF have been associated with various neurodevelopmental disorders, including the polymorphism Val66me which has been linked with lower dopamine and lower BDNF and correlated to anxiety and depression (Hünnerkopf et al. 2007). Knowing one’s Val66Met status, via genetic testing, can inform personalized plans for exercise, dietary factors i.e. omega-3s which also can increase BDNF (Ziaei et al. 2024). 

4.9 Cholinergic systems
Choline, while not an amino-acid , is commonly found in protein-rich foods and plays a crucial role in acetylcholine synthesis and membrane integrity in neurons. Choline has had a positive effect on ADHD in studies (Derbyshire and Maes 2023). There are recent studies now targeting imbalances in the cholinergic systems representing a new focus in ADHD etiology(Johansson et al. 2013). 

 
4.10 GABAergic (γ-aminobutyric acid)– system

 (GABA), the most abundant inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (CNS). While the GABAergic system has not traditionally been implicated as a main cause of ADHD, many studies have proven ADHD subjects have reduced GABA concentration compared with control subjects (Edden et al. 2012) suggest impaired inhibitory tone and potential sleep disruption,  contributing towards hyperactivity (Puts et al. 2020) .
 Circuit-level dysregulation of GABA, particularly involving excitation–inhibition (E/I) imbalance, has been been linked to neurotransmitter crosstalk, showing the pleiotropic nature of neuroransmitters. For example how  the excitatory glutamate transmitter binds to the inhibitory GABAA receptor, thereby allosterically potentiating its inhibitory function. (Chai 2025) . (Mamiya et al. 2021) propose E/I balance as a candidate biomarker for ADHD, stating the development of GABA modulating interventions as high potential candidates.  
4.11 Implications for Dietary Strategy
 Supporting GABA synthesis, signaling, and receptor modulation through dietary inputs may provide a novel, underexplored avenue for intervention. GABA is one example how the broad food matrix support for neurotransmitters is key in creating overall neurotransmitter production balance and potentially bringing better E/I balance to improve ADHD symptoms.  Targeting regular dietary neurotransmitter precursors and cofactors should have a positive effect on cognition and ADHD symptoms such as attention and hyperactivity. 

Taken together, these examples show that neurotransmitter support in ADHD cannot be reduced to a single molecule like dopamine, but instead emerges from a network of interacting systems where diet can exert meaningful leverage. 
4.12 Looking beyond dietary strategies for neurochemical support
Although not traditionally considered a target in ADHD treatment, oxytocin has been linked also to reducing impulsivity in ADHD while studies have also found dopamine levels involved in ADHD etiology impair oxytocin levels in children with ADHD(Esra DEMİRCİ 1 2016) . The modulation of oxytocin through diet, lifestyle, and social connection represents a promising avenue for holistic lifestyle and dietary support. The BRAIN Diet framework promotes endogenous oxytocin production through lifestyle strategies like mindful meals and shared eating, and also fermented foods that support the gut and vagus signaling. We also briefly discuss below (section 


4	Fats: Omega-3 & Brain-Healthy Fats 

The Role of Fats in Brain Function
Fats, or dietary lipids, are a fundamental pillar of brain health, influencing everything from membrane composition to inflammatory tone and neurotransmitter regulation. This section looks at omega-3 specifically but below we also cover fats which help minimise oxidation in cooking or fats that introduce antioxidants and other nutrient rich substances like CoQ10 in extra virgin olive oil. Many other fats offer great nutritional value are commonly overlooked such as duck fat,  MCT oil, and certain nuts, and avocado (see table 4 below).
Cardiovascular Guidelines and Relevance to Brain Health
Dietary guidelines from the World Health Organization and the Dietary Reference Intakes recommend a total fat intake between 20 and 35% of total calories(A. G. Liu et al. 2017) , with the NHS stating 30g limit of saturated fats per day for males and 20g for women and not more than 5g of transfats per day. (NHS.gov 2023).  A 30 year longitudinal study (Yanping Li et al. 2015) found that replacing 5% of energy intake from saturated fats with equivalent calories from PUFAs, monounsaturated fats, or whole grain carbohydrates was associated with a 25%, 15%, and 9% lower risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), respectively.
Further guidance and clinical guideline averages of daily values:
•	Monounsaturated fats (MUFA) — ~10–15%
Sources: extra-virgin olive oil, avocado, olives, nuts.
•	Omega-3 (PUFA) — ~1–2% and 250–500 mg EPA+DHA/day (RCT variations: 500–2000 mg/day)
•	Saturated fat (SFA) — <10% (ideally <7%) lard, butter, meats. 
Note: some short-/medium-chain SFAs may have niche metabolic roles i.e. MCT, Lauric acid. Butryrate . 
•	Trans fats — 0%
Eliminate industrial trans fats; margarine, vegetable shortening “partially hydrogenated oils” on labels.

The bidirectional link between heart health and brain health is well documented. Poor cardiovascular function is associated with impaired stress responses, reduced cognitive performance, and increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease. ADHD itself has been correlated with higher CHD risk (L. Li et al. 2022), though meta-analyses highlight the need for better-controlled studies due to key confounding factors not being controlled such as exercise and diet . However, when designing a diet targeting brain health, cardiovascular protection remains a critical co-priority.
Reframing Saturated Fat: miconutrient specifics
The BRAIN Diet prioritizes fats that reduce inflammation, support membrane integrity, and optimize cognitive performance, rather than enforcing blanket restrictions on all sources of saturated fat or cholesterol. While excessive intake is linked to cardiovascular risk, both nutrients serve critical physiological roles, with cholesterol being essential for synapse formation, myelin integrity, and the production of steroid-based neurohormones (Pfrieger 2003). 
Instead of excluding them, dietary strategies should focus on unprocessed, nutrient-dense sources such as Parmesan cheese, grass-fed butter, and pasture-raised egg yolks. When consumed in moderation within an anti-inflammatory, micronutrient-rich diet, these foods can provide essential brain nutrients including choline, vitamin K2, butyrate, and fat-soluble vitamins A, D, and E. Beyond just the wide array and vitamins and minerals there are a wide array of powerful and proven nutrients which are still underresearched but have great potentional(Table 4.) i.e. C15:0 (Parmesan and grassfed Butter), asataxanthin (Fish roes), moreover as we consider the wider implications of the food matrix,  studies have shown that hard cheeses with high calcium do not raise serum LDL levels(Soerensen et al. 2014).

Artificial Trans Fats	Linked to cognitive decline, neuroinflammation, and metabolic disorders	Ultra-processed foods, cheap margarines
Table 5 – Fats to be avoided or limited
3.1 Omega 3 Mechanisms of Action and success factors
Lipids constitute 50–60% of dry weight of mature human brain with  35% of these comprising of PUFA with long chain (LC-PUFA) PUFA n-6 content reaching 17% (mainly Arachidonic Acid) and the content of PUFA n-3 DHA was as much as 14%, depending upon the brain region (McNamara and Carlson 2006). 

Omega-3 fatty acids, particularly EPA and DHA, exert multifaceted effects on brain function that extend beyond their structural roles in neuronal membranes. Their actions influence gene expression, neurotransmission, inflammation resolution, and synaptic plasticity through a network of interrelated pathways.  . These include modulation of nuclear receptor signaling through  PPAR proteins, support for phospholipid membrane dynamics, and the generation of specialized proresolving mediators (SPMs) that downregulate inflammatory responses.
 
Figure 4 – The omega 3 mechanisms of action - TBC

Success Factors
The balance between omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids 

While arachidonic acid (AA), an omega-6 PUFA, gives rise to mostly pro-inflammatory eicosanoids, omega-3s like eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and DHA are precursors to anti-inflammatory SPMs such as resolvins, marensins and protectins. Western diets can skew this ratio as high as 20:1 in favor of omega-6s, contributing to chronic inflammation and neurotransmitter dysregulation (Simopoulos 2011) while also increasing blood viscosity, vasospasm, and vasoconstriction which may play a major role in inducing autoimmune, cardiovascular and neurological diseases. (Simopoulos 2009). 

Most research showing brain function improvements  lean towards higher ratio of EPA to DHA (e.g., 2:1 ratio or higher though Stonehouse et al used a DHA dominant dose) with DHA having a more structural role in the brain and EPA witha more functional role.  (McNamara and Carlson 2006)One meta study(Pei-Chen Chang 2021)(Stonehouse et al. 2013). Phospholipid Transport and DHA/EPA Delivery across the Blood Brain Barrier.

DHA or EPA  incorporated into PC and converted into lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) crosses the blood-brain barrier (BBB) far more efficiently than its free fatty acid or triglyceride-bound forms (Patrick 2019) . Studies show phospholipid-bound omega-3s such as krill oil and fish roe, provide EPA/DHA in  a  phospholipid form that gets easily converted to LPC was 1.9-fold more efficacious for  brain gray matter DHA accretion in porcine models (Liu et al. 2014)(L. Liu et al. 2014) . Krill oil is also a favored food source of DHA and EPA and since it is low in the food chain, does not concentrate environmental toxins or heavy metals and typically carries a lower heavy-metal burden than oils from higher-trophic fish (Colletti et al. 2021)(Patted et al. 2024).
In APOE4 gene carriers and blood biomarkers
Non-APOE4 carrying individuals three times greater DHA uptake into the brain than APOE4 carriers (Arellanes et al. 2020) highlighting the importance of considering genetic variability in omega-3 intervention trials. This may help explain inconsistent or modest results in Alzheimer’s studies using DHA, where up to 40% of participants carry the APOE4 allele. 
Mechanisms of Action of omega-3
Specialized Pro-Resolving Mediators and Inflammation Resolution

Specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs), derived from omega-3s (DHA and EPA), play an active role in terminating inflammation without suppressing immune surveillance. These include resolvins, protectins, and maresins, which exert effects such as inhibition of neutrophil infiltration, downregulation of COX-2, and enhancement of macrophage-mediated clearance of cellular debris (Serhan and Petasis 2011). Moreover, SPMs modulate endothelial function through nitric oxide release and support neuroprotection by limiting glutamate-induced excitotoxicity and promoting regulatory T-cell differentiation (Briones et al. 2025).  Although inflammation typically isolates tissues that have been injured or infected and begins the repair of an injury it is important to resolve and end the inflammatory response.  SPMs are lipids that accomplish this without generalized immunosuppression.  

In a controlled endotoxemia model(Ferguson et al. 2014), high-dose EPA+DHA (3.6 g/day) attenuated fever and downstream cytokines (IL-6, IL-10), even though TNF-α remained unchanged, suggesting that omega-3s reshape the resolution phase of acute inflammation rather than block its initiation. The endotoxemia model is discussed as an analogue of postprandial inflammation, which is highly relevant as we detail below ADHD is associated with metabolic disorders, and specifically linked to postprandial inflammation(Brown et al. 2025). 

Membrane Phospholipids, Ion Channels, and Gamma Activity 
Omega-3s such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and structural fats like linoleic acid contribute to neuronal membrane fluidity, neurogenesis and neuroplasticity (Crupi, Marino, and Cuzzocrea 2013). Phospholipid methylation (PLM), a process enhanced by dopamine D4 receptor activity, a key gene implicated in ADHD (Martel et al. 2011), alters the structure of membranes, facilitating faster neuronal recovery while influencing ion channel behavior in the generation of gamma oscillations, brainwaves linked to attention and cognition. Abnormalities in membrane composition and PLM have been linked to impaired ion channel regulation and reduced gamma-band activity in ADHD ((Cocchi et al. 2017) (Wilson et al. 2012)).   Phospholipid methylation, dependent on SAMe (see methylation Section 3.2), directly affects membrane fluidity and neurotransmitter receptor function. Maintaining optimal intake of phospholipid precursors, choline, methionine, and serine, may support PLM and cognitive performance. 
Endocannabinoid System Dysregulation & N-Acyl Lipid Signaling
 The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is a key neuromodulatory system that helps regulate dopamine signaling(Covey et al. 2017) and motivation(Laksmidewi and Soejitno 2021), stress response, and inflammation, processes that are often disrupted in ADHD and other neurodevelopmental conditions. A major pathway supporting this system is the CDP-ethanolamine pathway, which produces phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)—a key brain phospholipid and poential ADHD biomarker. PE can be converted into phosphatidylcholine (PC) or N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamines (NAPEs)(Garani, Watts, and Mizrahi 2021). These NAPEs are precursors to N-acyl ethanolamines (NAEs) like palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), oleoylethanolamide (OEA), and anandamide (AEA), bioactive lipids which act as neuromodulators with anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, and mood-regulating effects.  High plasma levels of AEA have been correlated to psychotic disorders and  lower levels to MDD while higher levels have also been associated with ADHD (Brunkhorst-Kanaan et al. 2021). 
Supporting NAPEs production through diet via PE-rich foods like eggs, fish roe, and liver may enhance ECS tone. Clinical trials have shown a doubling of plasma levels after dietary increases in oat bran due to it’s rich PE content (Sean Davies 2018). Polyphenols such as genistein may further enhance ECS tone by inhibiting fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), the enzyme responsible for AEA degradation (Gibellini and Smith 2010).  
Additionally, polyphenols such as genistein may help preserve AEA levels by inhibiting fatty acid amide hydrolase FAAH, the enzyme that breaks down AEA (Gibellini and Smith 2010). So by preserving anandamide, Genistein may amplify the ECS's ability to regulate dopamine(Bare, Ghetti, and Richter 1995), glutamate, and GABA signaling (Huang, Fang, and Dillon 1999) all key pathways to regulate in ADHD.
Although omega-3s are not direct endocannabinoids, they contribute to endocannabinoid-like signaling through the production of docosahexaenoyl ethanolamide (DHEA) , EPEA(Watson, Kim, and Das 2019), and other N-acyl ethanolamines, and can indirectly affect ECS system. While more research on the endocannabinoid pathways and ADHD is needed, its interactions with dopamine, mood regulation, and inflammation make it a relevant secondary target, particularly in cases of emotional dysregulation or stress sensitivity.

Considerations and Safety of Omega-3 Supplementation

Finally, although omega-3 supplementation is generally safe, a meta-analysis has reported a modestly increased risk of atrial fibrillation in individuals with predisposing cardiovascular conditions receiving high-dose omega-3 supplements, indicating the need for individual risk stratification ( f et al. 2021).

3.2 Homocysteine, Methylation, and Cognitive Function
Methylation is a fundamental biochemical process by which methyl groups (–CH₃) are added to molecules, playing a pivotal role in neurotransmitter synthesis, phospholipid metabolism, and gene expression. In the context of ADHD, nutrient-dependent methylation supports the recycling of homocysteine into methionine, a precursor to S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), the body’s universal methyl donor. SAMe not only fuels the synthesis of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin, but also drives phospholipid methylation in neuronal membranes essential for membrane fluidity, signal transduction, and neurotransmitter receptor function. 
B vitamins, particularly B6, B2, folate (5-MTHF), and B12, are essential cofactors in the remethylation of homocysteine (Hcy) to methionine, which is subsequently converted to S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe).
Riboflavin (B2) is a precursor to the key coenzymes FMN (Flavin mononucleotide) and FAD Flavin adenine dinucleotide. FAD acts as a critical cofactor for MTHFR, linking riboflavin to homocysteine recycling and methylation capacity. Riboflavin coenzymes facilitate the metabolism also of B12, vitamin B6, and niacin. (Aragão et al. 2024)
A large meta analysis shows that folic acid supplementation (0.5 5 mg/day) typically reduces plasma homocysteine by ~25% (from ~12 µmol/L to ~8 9 µmol/L.  In those studies, adding B12 gave an additional ~7% reduction over folate alone(Collaboration 1998). However while folate (vitamin B9) is normally considered to be the primary nutrient for homocysteine reduction, long chain ω 3 fatty acids and vitamin B12 also contribute meaningfully and in combination more effectively. For example one study with 3 groups taking supplementations of 1: vitamin B-12, 2: fish oil, and 3:vitamin B-12+fish oil, lowered plasma Hcy concentrations by 22%, 19%, and 39%, respectively (Tao Huang et al. 2015) . A reanlysis of the VITACOG trial data further demonstrated that B vitamin supplementation slowed cognitive decline only in participants with adequate omega-3 status (Oulhaj et al. 2016)(Oulhaj et al. 2016). These findings support a nutrient synergy model, in which B vitamins and omega-3 fatty acids function interdependently within methylation, membrane stability, and neuroinflammatory pathways.

Elevated plasma homocysteine, a byproduct of methylation, is frequently elevated in ADHD and other neurodegenerative disorders (Yu et al. 2020), (Luzzi et al. 2022), cognitive impairment, and psychiatric conditions (Lukovac et al. 2024a).  Hcy is implicated in the induction of oxidative stress, the modulation of oxygen levels, and the initiation of lipid peroxidation pathway(Lukovac et al. 2024b).
Trimethylglycine (TMG), also known as betaine, is a dietary methyl donor that helps recycle Hcy to methionine via an alternative pathway. Choline, a precursor to both TMG and phosphatidylcholine (PC), is similarly involved in homocysteine clearance and, as discssued above,  membrane phospholipid biosynthesis. These pathways are vulnerable to genetic variants such as MTHFR polymorphisms, which reduce the efficiency of folate cycling and methylation, thereby increasing susceptibility to cognitive dysfunction and ADHD-related symptoms.
Dietary patterns can modulate gene expression and epigenetic regulation through multiple pathways, although the strength of evidence varies by gene. For example, nutrients involved in one-carbon metabolism (e.g., folate, riboflavin, B12, choline) can influence methylation dynamics relevant to MTHFR and COMTactivity. Polyphenols and omega-3 fatty acids have been shown to upregulate BDNF expression, potentially offsetting functional impacts of the common Val66Met polymorphism. In contrast, links between diet and circadian genes such as VIPR2 remain largely indirect, primarily through feeding schedules and metabolic cues ( See section 9 – Circadian Rhytms). 
Section Summary
These studies indicate that while a combination of B-vitamins and omega-3s can significantly reduce homocysteine, a more holistic approach is warranted. The real-world biochemistry of cognition, neuroprotection, and homocysteine metabolism depends on a broader micronutrient network. As we detail throughout this paper, addressing these interrelated pathways together may yield even greater cognitive benefits and more substantial reductions in homocysteine.
5	Carbs , Fibre and Gut Health 
Brain Fuel and Complex Carbs for a Healthy Gut Biome 
Carbohydrate selection is critical to regulating core biological processes relevant to brain function. Poor carbohydrate choices may contribute to insulin dysregulation, inflammation, obesity, and other metabolic disorders (Cho and Choi 2021) Because the brain has limited capacity to store energy, maintaining a steady supply of glucose is essential for optimal cognitive function, unless a ketogenic dietary pattern is being followed , and risks have to be carefully assessed.(Crosby et al. 2021)
6.1 Resistant Starches 
The inclusion of complex carbohydrates and fermentable fibres plays a central role in supporting metabolic health and brain function. Complex carbohydrates consist of long chains of sugar molecules, such as starch and fibre, that digest more slowly, providing a steady release of glucose. Key sources include whole grains (including puesdo grains like quinoa and buckwheat, grains like barley and oats), fibrous vegetables, and legumes such as lentils and chickpeas. In parallel, both soluble fibre (from apples, oats, flaxseeds) and insoluble fibre (from vegetables, nuts, and whole grains) support digestive health, glycemic control, and microbial diversity, factors increasingly linked to improved cognition, emotional regulation, and long-term neuroprotection (Massimino et al. 1998).
The complex carbohydrate, Resistant Starch, forms when certain starchy foods are cooked and then cooled, a process called retrogradation. Foods like rice and potatoes develop higher resistant starch content when chilled, and reheating does not reverse this effect one example i.e. white rice was cooled and reheated showing a rise in RS content from 0.64 to 1.65 g/100 g and elicited a lower glycemic response(Yunting Li et al. 2024). 
These indigestible starches are fermented by gut bacteria in the colon, producing short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) such as butyrate, which help maintain gut barrier integrity, reduce systemic inflammation, and influence brain function through immune, endocrine, and vagal pathways(Zhou et al. 2015).

6.2 Possibilities and Challenges with Gut microbiome science
A growing body of evidence suggests that modulating the gut microbiome can positively influence brain health and overall health. The gut is central in producing neurotransmitters, reducing systemic inflammation and enhancing gut-brain axis communication with fibre and fermented foods playing a central role in all of those processes (Wastyk et al. 2021).
The gut microbiome’s two dominant bacterial phyla are Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, and their relative abundance (the Firmicutes:Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio) is often considered a broad indicator of gut “balance” or dysbiosis. (Schleupner and Carmichael 2022). Studies have shown how by increasing the diversity of taxa can increase the posibilities for individuals to produce certain health beneficial metabolites such as Urolithin A (Schleupner and Carmichael 2022), or increase omega 3 metabolism (Zinkow et al. 2024)  and reduce down stream harmful gut metabolites (Brown, Clardy, and Xavier 2023).

Studies have shown conflicting results in categorising micro biata of ADHD subjects and in general the taxonomy is still evolving.  (Wang et al. 2024) noted reduced levels of beneficial bacteria such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Bifidobacterium, but conversely (Aarts et al. 2017) found that individuals with ADHD had slightly increased Bifidobacterium.  Aarts highlighted that just naming a genus like Bifidobacterium doesn’t reveal its functional impact i..e while one species produce anti-inflammatory SCFAs; another they found spiked phenylalanine levels; the key is really dealing with gut bacteria at the strain level. 

6.3 The gut brain axis
The gut-brain connection may also play a significant role in the etiology of ADHD(Jiang et al. 2018). Gut health influences the production of neurotransmitters and their precursors, including serotonin, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and dopamine. While gut-derived neurotransmitters are unlikely to cross the blood–brain barrier (BBB), their precursors, such as tryptophan and tyrosine, do, enabling local synthesis in the brain(O’Mahony et al. 2015a). 
In addition, gut–brain signaling occurs via the vagus nerve, which transmits microbial and neurochemical cues to influence mood and motivation. Vagal stimulation has demonstrated clinical benefits in depression, epilepsy, and inflammation(Austelle et al. 2022) while we detail below preclinical work that shows that gut microbes such as Lactobacillus can alter brain GABA receptor expression through vagal pathways  (Bravo et al., 2011). 
6.4 Gut Barrier Integrity and Cognitive Function
The gut barrier is the dynamic interface between the microbiome, immune system, and brain. Its integrity is critical: when the barrier weakens, bacterial fragments such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS, a bacterial endotoxin)  and dietary antigens enter circulation, sustaining chronic low-grade inflammation and altering neurotransmitter metabolism. These processes are strongly correlated with poor cognitive function, fatigue, mood instability, and ADHD symptom severity.
The barrier is organized into four interdependent layers, each with distinct vulnerabilities that can compromise brain health:
•	Microbiota layer – weakened by loss of fibre and polyphenols; reduced SCFA production removes protection against pathogens.
•	Mucus layer – eroded by low plant diversity and ultra-processed foods, leaving epithelial cells exposed.
•	Epithelial layer (tight junctions) – disrupted by nutrient deficiencies (zinc, vitamin D), alcohol, NSAIDs, and chronic stress, increasing permeability (“leaky gut”).
•	Immune layer (gut-associated lymphoid tissue, GALT) – dysregulated by omega-3 deficiency and low vitamin A, weakening IgA surveillance and tolerance.
When these weaknesses converge, lipopolysaccharide (LPS, a bacterial endotoxin) crosses into the bloodstream, fueling systemic inflammation, impairing insulin sensitivity(Mohammad and Thiemermann 2021), that inflammation has also been linked to disrupting dopamine and serotonin pathways and causing depression(Batey et al. 2024) . Metabolic endotoxemia (ME), defined as chronically elevated circulating lipopolysaccharide (LPS), is very common, while detection is difficult and unreliable, estimates of up to one-third of adults in Western populations are common, particularly those with obesity or high-fat, low-fibre diets. Even modest elevations in LPS can sustain low-grade inflammation, impair insulin sensitivity, and promote neuroinflammatory cascades that compromise dopamine signaling and cognitive resilience.  Similarly, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) impairs absorption of vitamin B12, iron, and tryptophan , depriving the brain of essential neurotransmitter precursors.
The Diet will directly target these vulnerabilities by nature of it’s green mediterranean high-polyphenol plant food targets, prebiotic fibres, fermented products, and barrier-supportive nutrients, thereby reinforcing barrier function and reducing LPS-driven endotoxemia. Many factors, other that poor diet i.e. antibiotics and other medications, lack of physical activity, and environmental factors, may contribute to intestinal dysbiosis and, as a result, to the development of ME. 


6.5 Prebioics and probiotics
Interventions such as prebiotics, probiotics, high-fibre diets, and fermented foods, collectively referred to in emerging research as psychobiotics(Mohamed and Kobeissy 2024a), have been associated with changes in attentional vigilance and mood regulation (Schmidt et al. 2015) with galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) being linked to reduced anxiety and cortisol,  (Johnstone et al. 2021). These effects are thought to be, in the main,  mediated through increased production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) like butyrate, which support intestinal barrier integrity, regulate immune responses, antioxidant activity(Wang et al. 2022) , and promote the synthesis of key neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin(Silva et al. 2020). While more large-scale clinical trials are needed, current research supports the gut microbiome as a promising, non-invasive target for adjunctive ADHD treatment.  


6.6 Short-Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs) 

Diets rich in probiotics, prebiotics, and fibre (which help produce short-chain fatty acids like butyrate, Propionate and lactate) can enhance gut health. Furthermore, a decreased microbial diversity (alpha diversity) has also been reported in ADHD (Prehn-Kristensen et al. 2018) and may contribute to  ‘leaky gut’ syndrome and contribute to the low-grade systemic inflammation reported in ADHD. 
These are byproducts of fibre fermentation in the gut and have been linked to improving brain function via either the gut-brain axis or in some cases such as Butyrate by crossing the blood brain barrier. SCFAs play a crucial role in various physiological processes, including maintaining gut health, modulating the immune system, and influencing brain function. A recent study (Steckler et al. 2024) showed the ADHD group exhibiting significantly lower levels of key SCFAs, including acetic, propionic, isobutyric, isovaleric, and valeric acids, highlighting a distinct microbial and metabolic profile. 
Butyrate:  Butyrate and other SCFA deficiencies have been linked to many neurological disorders(Deng et al. 2019) including ADHD (Fan et al. 2019)but many of the studies are not in-human studies or have been noted for other confounding factors in study design despite some sensible stratification of study subjects (Checa-Ros et al. 2021; Kurokawa et al. 2024). Butyrate deficiencies where also linked to ASD and melatonin production and loosely infered to have relevance in ADHD populations due to symptom cross over and disorder pathways. 
•	Sleep Disorders: (Checa-Ros et al. 2021b) Also linked butyrate deficiencies to also melatonin production and ASD, while loosely inferring relevance to ADHD populations due to symptom cross over and disorder pathways. Sleep deprevation and low melatonin were also associted with a significant decrease in microbial diversity and richnes.  Sleep disorders can be present in up to 70% of ADHD patients so they represent one of the most frequent comorbidities in children with ADHD(Cortese et al. 2009) underscoring the potential of gut biome diversity and  butyrate levels.
•	 Neuroinflammation Reduction: Butyrate has anti-inflammatory effects, potentially reducing neuroinflammation associated with ADHD (Yunting Li et al. 2024)
•	Energy Metabolism: Butyrate supports mitochondrial function, enhancing brain energy metabolism, which may help with cognitive impairments seen in ADHD (Rose et al. 2018) while also aiding in reducing cholesterol and neuroinflammation (Cavaliere et al. 2022). 
Propionate research suggests that increased propionate levels could help reduce neuroinflammation(Grüter et al. 2023) and enhance cognitive function while protecting the blood-brain barrier (Hoyles et al. 2018) and stimulate the secretion of norepinephrine, possibly benefiting ADHD symptoms like attention and focus.
•	Additionally, propionate might influence dopamine regulation (Mirzaei et al. 2021), which plays a role in reward processing and impulsivity, key areas affected in ADHD.
Bifidobacterium. A lowered abundance of Bifidobacterium longum in infancy has been associated with increased risk of developing ADHD and Asperger syndrome in childhood (Pärtty et al. 2015); the same study also showed early administration of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG may reduce the risk of ADHD and AS,  however due to the small study size, such findings are best interpreted as hypothesis-generating, highlighting a potentially critical early-life window for microbiome modulation rather than providing definitive evidence of prevention. Larger studies are needed


Lactobacillus was shown to product acetycholine in a study dating back to 1947 (Stephenson et al. 1947) and such strains have also been shown to be effective against Alzeimer’s disease induced rat models(Nimgampalle 2017).

Several species in the Lactobacillus genus used in medical research include: Rhamnosus GG (L GG) which has been shown to stabilize the gut permeability barrier by mucin production and antigen-specific immunoglobulin A production(Khailova et al. 2017) (Khailova et al. 2017). In addition, a recent experimental study has demonstrated that Lactobacillus rhamnosus regulates, again via the vagus nerve, emotional behavior and the influences the central GABAergic system and serotonin (Bravo et al. 2011). 


Levilactobacillus brevis is one of the key bacteria known to produce GABA. It produces GABA through the glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) pathway , where it converts glutamate into GABA (Cataldo et al. 2024). This bacteria is active in L. brevis strains isolated from fermented foods, such as kimchi, kefir, and pickles. One isolated strain, CRL 2013 (Kim et al. 2009),  found in quinoa sourdough (Chiş et al. 2020) , offers both very high nutrients (due to the quinoa) and a high GABA profile. Importantly, traditional sourdough fermentation supports the growth of beneficial lactic acid bacteria, lowers pH, and pre-digests antinutrients, helping deliver live or metabolically active microbes and their bioactives to the gut, supporting microbial diversity and neurotransmitter-linked metabolic pathways.

Faecalibacterium is known for its anti-inflammatory properties. The scarcity of this genus could potentially lead to overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which aligns with the high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines found in children with ADHD and it’s low levels correlating to ADHD symptons in children(Jiang et al. 2018) and allergies such as Th2-mediated atopic disorders like asthma and allergic rhinitis, which when present in children were associated with a 30–50% higher chance of developing ADHD (Bull-Larsen and Mohajeri 2019). 





6.7 Dietary Strategies to Enrich Beneficial Microbes and Suppress Pathobionts

In line with the BRAIN Diet’s emphasis on a Green-MED dietary pattern enriched with high-polyphenol foods, the approach is designed not only to support strain-specific microbial targets but also to remodel the microbiome ecosystem more broadly. The diet implements practical strategies, including prebiotic fibres, polyphenol-rich foods, fermented products, and circadian-aligned eating, that enhance microbial diversity, reinforce barrier integrity, and suppress overgrowth states such as SIBO (Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth).  These mechanics are summarized in the table below, outlining how different dietary levers converge to create a resilient, SCFA-producing microbial environment that supports gut–brain communication.

Category	Strategy / Examples	Primary Targets / Effects
Prebiotic Fibres	Inulin (chicory, onions), GOS (legumes), resistant starch (cooled potatoes, green bananas), pectin (apples)	↑ Bifidobacterium, Akkermansia; ↑ butyrate production; improved gut barrier
Polyphenol Sources	Berries, green tea catechins, cocoa flavanols, cranberries, pomegranate	↑ Faecalibacterium, Roseburia; inhibit Enterobacteriaceae; reduce NF-κB activation
Fermented Foods	Sauerkraut, kimchi, kefir, miso, kombucha	Live microbes + postbiotic peptides; improved SCFA pools; vagal signaling
Limiting Substrates	Reduce refined sugars, emulsifiers, ultra-processed foods	↓ Pathobiont overgrowth (Enterobacteriaceae, Clostridiumspp.); ↓ endotoxin (LPS) load
Antimicrobial Lipids	Medium-chain triglycerides (MCT oil, coconut oil), caprylic acid	Direct inhibition of pathobionts (Candida, C. difficile) without harming commensals
Rhythmic Inputs	Circadian-aligned eating, overnight fasting windows, consistent meal timing	Entrains microbial diurnal rhythms; stabilizes ENS–HPA–ANS communication
Dietary Diversity	≥30 plant foods per week (herbs, spices, legumes, grains, nuts, vegetables, fruits)	Microbial richness and resilience; ↑ functional redundancy; ↓ risk of dysbiosis
Overgrowth Suppression (SIBO, Candida, Pathobionts)	Polyphenol antimicrobials (berberine, oregano, green tea); short-term low-FODMAP when needed; prokinetic foods (ginger); Green-MED + fermented food diet	↓ SIBO recurrence, ↓ LPS translocation, ↑ nutrient absorption (B12, iron, tryptophan), ↑ SCFA resilience

Taken together, these strategies not only recalibrate the microbiome but may also directly influence pathways central to ADHD, restoring neurotransmitter precursors such as tryptophan (Sinha et al. 2024), dampening LPS-driven inflammation, and stabilizing gut–brain signaling networks that underpin attention, mood, and cognitive resilience. Clinical trials are needed at scale that test a multipronged strategy to improve gut health while targeting gut metabolites which can improve and support brain health and in turn improve ADHD symptoms and the symptoms of other mental disorders. 
6.8	Key dietary Cascades

Cascade 6.8.1 — Neurotransmitter Precursor Restoration
 

Cascade 6.8.1 — Neurotransmitter Precursor Restoration:
Enhancing dietary protein, prebiotics, and microbiome diversity promotes microbial metabolism and absorption of key amino acids, increasing tryptophan and tyrosine availability for central serotonin and dopamine synthesis. This pathway supports mood regulation and cognitive performance. (Sinha et al. 2024)(O’Mahony et al. 2015b) 
Cascade 2.5 — Microbiome Biotransformation & Mitochondrial Resilience
 
 
 Higher polyphenol intake and microbial diversity increase urolithin A  (Singh et al. 2022) and related metabolites, supporting mitochondrial resilience and mitophagy and in turn improving cognitive endurance (Andreux et al. 2019) (Hou et al. 2024).. Hypothesis: these effects may extend to executive function (to be tested via Stroop/task-switching/n-back).

Promoting keystone taxa supports anti-inflammatory states and may reduce neurodevelopmental risk while enhancing cognitive resilience.
Cascade 6.6 — Dietary Remodeling of Microbial Ecology

[Polyphenol- & fibre-rich foods + fermented products + circadian alignment ↑] → [SCFA producers ↑ & microbial diversity ↑] → [Gut–brain signaling stability ↑ ; Stress reactivity ↓]
(Schmidt et al., 2015; Johnstone et al., 2021; Mohamed & Kobeissy, 2024a)
Implication :
Dietary remodeling of the microbiome fosters SCFA producers and microbial diversity, stabilizing gut–brain signaling and stress responses.


7	Antioxidants  and Oxidative Stress
7.1 Oxidative Stress overview 
Oxidative stress arises when reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) exceed antioxidant capacity, damaging lipids, proteins, DNA, and impairing mitochondrial efficiency. In ADHD, adult cohorts frequently show elevated lipid peroxidation and oxidative indices, while antioxidant status appears normal or variably shifted, consistent with greater oxidative load rather than a primary antioxidant deficit. Multiple real-world factors contribute i.e. sleep and circadian disruption, glycaemic variability/insulin resistance, high-ω-6/oxidised oils, alcohol, smoke/pollution, and dietary source contaminants (metals, Ultra Processed Foods UPFs) . 
The BRAIN Diet targets this network by combining polyphenol-dense foods, omega-3s, sulfur amino acids (cysteine/glycine), and key cofactors (Se/Zn/Cu) with exposure control and gentler cooking to lower dietary AGE/ALE load. We treat oxidative stress as a state-sensitive, potentially modifiable contributor to symptom severity and predefine biomarkers to test whether lowering redox load improves outcomes. In neurodevelopmental conditions such as ADHD, there is increasing recognition that oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuroinflammation contribute to cognitive, emotional, and behavioral dysregulation.
Regarding oxidative stress, many studies have isolated potential biomarkers for ADHD, though some studies have sometimes shown marginal results there is a clear postive pattern showing oxidative stress as a correlation with ADHD.   (Bulut et al. 2007) was a foundational study finding significantly higher Malondialdehyde levels in adult ADHD, a lipid-peroxidation marker, compared with healthy controls, indicating increased oxidative stress.   More recently, (Kurhan and Alp 2021) reported a shift in thiol/disulfide homeostasis toward oxidation and higher urinary 8-OHdG (DNA oxidation) in adults with ADHD versus controls, consistent with increased oxidative damage. In an independent cohort, (Miniksar et al. 2023) found elevated oxidative stress index (OSI) / total oxidative status (TOS), supporting impaired redox balance in adult ADHD, suggesting malondialdehyde ( MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels may be effective biomarkers in diagnosing ADHD while they noted  the need to better understand the negative role of oxidative stress in ADHD. Below (section 7.6 ) we propose a further connected hypothesis of Oxidative Stress.

7.2 Antioxidant networks for increased protection
While the body has multiple endogenous antioxidant defenses, including enzymes like superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase, these can become overwhelmed in states of chronic inflammation, nutrient deficiency, or high metabolic demand. Lester Packer  introduced the concept of the "antioxidant network(Packer et al. 1997)," detailing how key compounds like vitamin E, vitamin C, lipoic acid, glutathione, and CoQ10 have been shown to work synergistically and regenerate each other in vivo. 
Although high-dose antioxidant supplements have shown inconsistent or even harmful effects in the rare case of the Vitamin E clinical trials and prostate cancer(Klein et al. 2011), diets rich in natural antioxidant compounds have demonstrated robust benefits. The Green Mediterranean Diet DIRECT-PLUS studies, led to significantly greater reductions in visceral adipose(Zelicha et al. 2022) and neuroprotective effects(Pachter et al. 2024)(Pachter et al. 2024). This effect was accompanied by increases in microbiome-derived metabolites like urolithin A, reinforcing the synergistic role of polyphenols, fibre, and gut-derived antioxidants in improving metabolic and cognitive resilience. 
The framework of the BRAIN Diet embraces:
•	The acknowledge of the theoretical strength of the antioxidant network i.e. working many different antioxidants into the diet and precursors for endogenous antioxidants
•	Emphasize food-based sources rich in polyphenols, flavonoids, and balanced antioxidants.
•	Avoid promoting high-dose single-nutrient supplementation unless there's clinical justification and consultation and agreement with healthcare professionals
•	Highlight synergy in whole-foods, not megadoses of any one food source.

Complex Antioxidant Networks and Mineral Cofactors
There are many scientific findings supporting dietary antioxidant treatment of ADHD which accounted for substantial alterations in the immune system, epigenetic regulation of gene expression, and oxidative stress regulation in ADHD and also how immune dysfunction results in increased IgE levels and allergies, another link between ADHD (A. Verlaet et al. 2018; Wesselink et al. 2019b). 
By supplying a spectrum of antioxidants (vitamins C and E, polyphenols, carotenoids, and omega 3 alongside mitochondrial supports (CoQ₁₀, lipoic acid, B-vitamins, k2) and trace minerals (selenium, zinc, copper), we can potentially increase the protection of neurons, preserve mitochondrial energy production, and reduce harmful inflammatory cascades, creating a better basis for optimal cognitive and emotional resilience. 

Antioxidant Family

The antioxidant family also includes essential minerals that serve as cofactors for antioxidant enzymes. Selenium, zinc, and manganese, for instance, are crucial for the proper functioning of various antioxidant systems within the body(Mocchegiani and Malavolta 2019). This intricate network of antioxidants works synergistically (Vertuani, Angusti, and Manfredini 2004), with each component complementing the others to maintain cellular health and prevent oxidative damage.

Isothiocyanates (ITCs) like sulforaphane, created through enzymatic activity from glucoraphanin  in broccoli, have also shown promising results in reducing oxidative stress and offering protection against various chronic diseases, including cancer and cardiovascular disorders while also showing higher bioavailability than other polyphenol-based dietary supplements that also activate Nrf2.(Houghton, Fassett, and Coombes 2016).

Phenolic acids represent some of the most abundant antioxidants in plant-based foods, with whole grains and bran being especially rich sources. Among these, ferulic acid stands out as a key compound illustrating how food matrix effects translate into brain resilience. Processing methods such as sprouting and fermentation profoundly shape polyphenol bioavailability releasing bound ferulic acid, and enhancing bioavailability. 
Cascade 7.1 — Food Matrix & Polyphenol Bioavailability
 
Once ferulic acid is absorbed, it crosses the blood–brain barrier, scavenges reactive oxygen species, and synergizes with vitamins C and E to stabilize neuronal membranes and preserve DHA. Such mechanisms highlight why dietary patterns emphasizing whole, minimally processed grains may deliver neuroprotective effects beyond their macronutrient profile.(Shi et al. 2021)

Carotenoids, particularly lutein, zeaxanthin, and β-carotene, play a neuroprotective role through their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. These fat-soluble pigments accumulate selectively in neural tissues, including the retina and brain, where they help scavenge reactive oxygen species and stabilize cell membranes (Johnson 2014)(Johnson, 2014). Lutein and zeaxanthin, for instance, have been associated with improved cognitive performance, especially in domains such as memory, processing speed, and visual-spatial function (Yagi et al. 2021) (Lieblein-Boff et al., 2015; Vishwanathan et al., 2014). β-carotene, as both an antioxidant and vitamin A precursor, also supports immune regulation and neuronal development. 

Carotenoids are abundant in leafy greens, orange and yellow vegetables, corn, and egg yolks. Their absorption is enhanced by dietary fat, and their preservation and bioavailability is influenced by cooking techniques, with excessive oxidation during high-speed mixing or prolonged exposure to heat shown to degrade carotenoid levels.  Research shows(Eliášová et al. 2020) that most of the antioxidant anthocyanins in colored-grain wheat are destroyed during traditional breadmaking, with retention often dropping below 30%. If processing is optimized e.g., sourdough fermentation, high-heat short baking etc this can be reduced. while prolonged cooking increases access to lycopene in tomatoes where cell walls need to be broken down(Fielding et al. 2005).

Endogenous Antioxidants 

Glutathione (GSH) is one of the body's major antioxidants. Low levels may suggest oxidative stress; elevated GSH levels which have been recorded against ADHD subjects which may reflect a compensatory response to increased oxidative stress (Verlaet et al. 2019). Furthermore, mitochondrial metabolism of lactate depends on GSH for ROS neutralization, optimizing mitochondrial energy use. 




7.2 Toxix Metals Reduction 
Heavy metals are detoxified in the body by metallothionein (MT) metal carrier proteins that must bind with Zn and copper (Cu) (Zhai et al. 2015)(Zhai et al., 2015). In women, a high-fiber (vegetarian) pattern showed near-complete fecal recovery of dietary cadmium and no increase in blood/urine Cd despite higher Cd intake, suggesting fibre/phytate-mediated inhibition of absorption; low ferritinwas the key predictor of higher body Cd (Berglund et al. 1994).

Cascade 7.2 — Mineral Adequacy & Metal Uptake
 
Cascade Caption 7.2: Repleting essential minerals (calcium, iron, zinc) together with dietary fibres, phytates, and polyphenols reduces gastrointestinal absorption of toxic metals (lead, cadmium, mercury, aluminium). This lowers systemic levels and blood–brain barrier transport, reduces brain metal accumulation, and ultimately decreases oxidative-stress burden and neurotransmission disruption. (Zhai et al.) (Berglund et al. 1994).

 ADHD has been linked with metals contamination and UPFs which contain among other additives high amounts of metals, particularly in food colourings; ADHD and other neuropsychiatric disorders have been also linked to maternal food habits such as high UPF consumption.(Dufault et al. 2024) . Besides heavy metals micro/nanoplastics (MNPs) are being linked to many diseases, reproductive health and ADHD; (Zhang et al. 2025). Anthocyanins, especially C3G-rich sources like berries, purple potatoes, and black goji, serve as:
•	Natural chelation agents for heavy metals and environmental contaminants
•	Neuroprotective molecules that support synaptic resilience and detox pathways
•	Detox allies against microplastics and hormone-disrupting pollutants
Multiple meta-analyses (e.g. Nigg et al. 2016; Goodlad et al. 2013) show blood lead levels <5 µg/dL are associated with increased ADHD risk, even at “low” environmental levels. Lead interferes with prefrontal cortex development, synaptic pruning, and dopamine signaling. While ADHD is associated with higher oxidative stress and weaker antioxidant defense (e.g. reduced glutathione, increased lipid peroxidation). Metals will generate ROS, so this adds another layer of vulnerability.
Dietary patterns common in ADHD (e.g. low micronutrient density, irregular meals, high sugar/processed food intake) can increase absorption of toxic metals while also sometimes containing lower competing minerals like calcium, iron, and zinc which bind to toxic metals(Zhai et al. 2015). This leaning towards a poor Western diets, characterised as Western diets are characterized by excess consumption of saturated fats, over-refined sugars, and animal-based protein and low consumption of plant-based fiber,  have been shown to have higher levels of oxidative stress and a greater risk of chronic disease(Jiang et al. 2021).  
Many studies have shown that cognitive impairment is associated with decreased antioxidant capacity and that low oxidative stress is also a hallmark of longevity(Belenguer-Varea et al. 2020), Although oxidative stress is not listed as a standalone ‘hallmark’ in the López-Otín framework, human studies in neurodegeneration consistently link redox imbalance to pathology and outcomes.(Houldsworth 2023). 
7.3 Other key antioxidants 
Many other studies have been carried out looking at antioxidant agents as modulators of mitochondrial function (Vásquez-Reyes et al. 2021) and antioxidants such as quercetin (Boots, Haenen, and Bast 2008), potentially due to quercetin’s link to enhancing mitochondrial baseline activity and energy production(Davis et al. 2009). 

Quercetin is an effecive antioxidant agent which scavenges ROS(Boots, Haenen, and Bast 2008) and has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-neuroinflammatory and neuroprotective properties(Tongjaroenbuangam et al. 2011). Isoquercetin (glycosylated quercetin) is more completely absorbed than quercetin in the aglycone form, and that the simultaneous ingestion of quercetin with vitamin C, folate and additional flavonoids improves bioavailability(Y. Li et al. 2016). Also studies have shown quercetin bound to a sugar molecule forming quercitrin has anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects may be augmented by the co-ingestion of N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and olive oil (Camuesco et al. 2006) (Camuesco et al. 2006). 
The estimated flavonoid intake ranges from 50 to 800 mg/day (About 75% of dietary polyphenol count is quercetin(Y. Li et al. 2016)). It is abundant in capers (Neveu V et al database 2010), apples , onions, berries, kale and soybeans. 
Genistein  a soy-derived isoflavonoid, has shown potential as a modulator of several biochemical pathways, including the endocannabinoid system and neuroinflammation (Fuloria et al. 2022), potentially enhancing the activity of certain endocannabinoids like anandamide (Thors, Eriksson, and Fowler 2007). It has been confirmed to have the ability to alleviate the deleterious effects of oxidative stress on neuronal injury, such as preventing neuronal death, increasing the production of hippocampal glutathione (GSH) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), and lowering lipid peroxidation, ROS, and nitric oxide production. Since genistein is believed to pass the blood–brain barrier to exert its neuroprotective effect, it is extensively applied in the investigation of the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s and Huntington’s(Fuloria et al. 2022). 
 
Coenzyme (CoQ10): This antioxidant and energy production cofactor has been associated with ADHD and levels may be improved through supplementation(Mantle and Hargreaves 2024). CoQ10 deficiency leads to reduced ATP production and mitochondrial dysfunction, which may contribute to the neurocognitive issues in ADHD (Szulc et al., 2018) . The decline in presence of CoQ10 in humans with age; is dramatic with over 50% depletion between 20 years of life and 60 years which also relates to dietary levels in animal organ meats which are the number one dietary source. Low levels of the coenzyme B6 can cause dysfunctions, prior to the formation of vitamin Q10, to DNA(Pravst, Zmitek, and Zmitek 2010). Organ meats are the highest source at upto 12mg per 100g,  with olive oil being  the the highest plant source though at .06- 2mg per 100g it is not possible to match therapeutic level doses. With great variations between producers and harvest time having been noted , total CoQ dropped by 53%-56% between three weeks of the harvesting of two brands (Zmitek, Rodríguez-Aguilera, and Pravst 2014; Deichmann, Lavie, and Andrews 2010).

7.7 Key Dietary Cascades Examples 
Cascade 7.3 — Example of Chocolate Matrix & Heavy-Metal Uptake (Cd/Pb)
 
Cascade 7.3 Caption: While dark chocolate has high antioxidants, heavy-metals increase with cocoa content; adding milk content raises available Ca/Zn to reduce intestinal absorption of cadmium and lead, lowering systemic burden and long-term brain accumulation, thereby easing oxidative-stress pressure. Practical measures like choosing higher-milk/lower-%-cocoa chocolate (plus low-Cd/Pb origins/strong post-harvest controls) will reduces cadmium/lead exposure, keeping mineral status high in serum and ideally. 
7.6 Testable Hypothesis:
Rather than treating MDA/SOD as just diagnostic markers of oxidative stress, they could be framed as a potentially modifiable amplifier of symptom severity of ADHD. Future clinical trials of the BRAIN Diet should explicitly test whether lowering redox load improves clinical outcomes. Comparing Total Antioxidant Capacity (TAC) with oxidative damage markers (e.g., MDA/4-HNE, 8-OHdG) before and after the trial against ADHD related cognitive biomarkers could be a real potential future biomarker for ADHD.


8	Mitochondrial Dysfunction
Brain mitochondrial dysfunction is increasingly recognised as a core contributor to a range of psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders, including Alzheimer’s (Aran and Singh 2023), Parkinson’s (Henrich et al. 2023), MDD (Y. Song et al. 2023), and ADHD (Verma et al. 2016) ,(Ogutlu, Kasak, and Tabur 2023) and more limited studies correlating it to ASD (Lombard 1998)(Khaliulin, Hamoudi, and Amal 2025). In ADHD specifically, mitochondrial inefficiency has been associated with oxidative stress (Wesselink et al. 2019), dopamine dysregulation, and impaired cognitive performance (Wesselink et al., 2019). These dysfunctions compromise ATP generation in high-demand tissues such as the brain, potentially contributing to the attentional, motivational, and executive function deficits observed in ADHD.
 
Figure 5 – Causes of Mitochondrial dysfunction	
Emerging evidence connecting mitochondria with behavioural outcomes.
•	Animal models: Impaired mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens has been shown to reduce social dominance behaviours in mice (Zalachoras et al. 2022)Strikingly, supplementation with nicotinamide, a dietary precursor to NAD⁺, restored mitochondrial efficiency and reversed these behavioural deficits in an anxiety-expressing mouse model ((Hollis et al. 2015). This suggests that mitochondrial bioenergetics are not only mechanistically linked to behaviour, but also potentially reversible through targeted nutritional support.
•	Human data: Large-scale analyses reinforce this connection. Using UK Biobank data, (L. Liu et al. 2023)identified significant associations between mitochondrial DNA variants (mtSNPs) and anxiety phenotypes, including elevated GAD-7 scores and self-reported anxiety. Importantly, these effects were amplified in the presence of systemic inflammation (C-reactive protein), indicating a mitochondria–immune–linked behaviour.

8.1 ATP for Mitochondrial Energy
Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) is the primary energy carrier in all cells and is crucial for maintaining normal cellular function ATP production decreases as a result of mitochondrial dysfunction. ATP markers from are associated with better global cognitive performance (MoCA scores) in healthy older adults(Lopez et al. 2023). In individuals with ADHD, mitochondrial dysfunction can lead to reduced ATP production, neurochemical imbalances, oxidative stress which impacts brain energy metabolism, cognition and attention (Ogutlu, Kasak, and Tabur 2023; Walther et al. 2023)..
Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD⁺) is a central coenzyme in oxidative phosphorylation, acting as an electron carrier that enables ATP generation. Incorporating NAD+ precursors into the BRAIN Diet reinforces mitochondrial energy metabolism, particularly in contexts of deficiency. Patients with adult-onset mitochondrial myopathy, niacin supplementation (750–1,000 mg/day) successfully restored blood and muscle NAD+ levels, up to eightfold, and improved mitochondrial biogenesis and muscle performance (Pirinen et al. 2020) underscoring niacin’s potential as an effective dietary intervention for enhancing mitochondrial function. 
Incorporating NAD⁺ precursors into the BRAIN Diet, Table X below)s (vitamin B₃), can reinforce mitochondrial energy metabolism, particularly in states of deficiency. In patients with adult-onset mitochondrial myopathy, high-dose niacin supplementation (750–1,000 mg/day) restored blood and muscle NAD⁺ levels by up to eightfold, improved mitochondrial biogenesis, and enhanced muscle performance (Pirinen et al., 2020). By sustaining NAD⁺ availability, mitochondrial ATP production remains efficient, supporting the neuronal energy demands required for sustained attention, motivation, and goal-directed behavior.
These findings reinforce the importance of nutrient strategies within the BRAIN Diet that support NAD⁺ availability, glutathione synthesis, and mitochondrial health, such as niacin-rich foods (e.g., salmon, chicken breast, turkey, peanuts, and mushrooms), sulphur-containing vegetables that provide glutathione precursors (e.g., broccoli, Brussels sprouts, garlic, onions), and polyphenol-rich sources (e.g., blueberries, green tea, dark chocolate, extra virgin olive oil). 


NAD⁺ Precursor	Role in NAD⁺ Metabolism	Key BRAIN Diet Food Sources
Niacin (Vitamin B₃)	Directly converted to NAD⁺ via salvage pathway (Pirinen et al. 2020). Lack of niacin hampers NAD+ regeneration, decreasing ATP production and potentially affecting cognitive performance	Chicken, turkey, tuna, salmon, mushrooms, peanuts, whole grains
Nicotinamide Riboside	Efficient NAD⁺ precursor with neuroprotective potential	Dairy milk, whey protein, yeast-containing foods (e.g., sourdough bread)
Tryptophan	Converted to NAD⁺ via kynurenine pathway	Turkey, chicken, eggs, pumpkin seeds, oats, soybeans
Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN)	Direct NAD⁺ intermediate in salvage pathway	Edamame, broccoli, cucumber, avocado
Polyphenols (e.g., resveratrol)	Activate SIRT1, enhancing NAD⁺-dependent processes	Grapes, blueberries, cranberries, peanuts, dark chocolate
Thiamine (B1):	is essential for mitochondrial glucose metabolism in the brain leading to ATP production. (Dhir et al. 2019))
Pork, sunflower seeds, salmon, peas, rice, lentils
Table X. Dietary Sources of NAD⁺ Precursors in the BRAIN Diet
8.2 Thiamin therapy and deficiency 
Thiamine is essential for mitochondrial glucose metabolism and ATP synthesis in neurons (Dhir et al. 2019). Thiamine does not appear to exist in a large brain “reservoir”; instead, the CNS maintains small, tightly regulated intracellular pools that depend on continuous, transporter-mediated supply(Spector & Johanson, 2007) making deficiency states potentially acute. While RDAs are low (~1.1–1.2 mg), therapeutic doses up to 100× higher have shown benefit in Alzheimer's disease and while other studies have shown mixed signals, larger Phase 2 trials in progress.
 One pilot study in children with autism showed improved behaviour and metal detoxification following administration of thiamine tetrahydrofurfuryl disulfide (TTFD) (Lonsdale, 2003) These effects were potentially due to enhanced mitochondrial function and reduced oxidative burden, researchers noted this was possibly due to the increased activity of the rhondanese enzyme which had been previously been proven to help excrete arsenic, the  intervention also increased urinary excretion of toxic metals such as arsenic and mercury both associated with neurological dysfunction, cognitive impairment, depressive symptoms, and allergic hypersensitivities (Quig 1998), mirroring ADHD pathophysiology.
8.3 Other Essential Brain vitamins and minerals 

Magnesium  is involved in over 300 enzymatic reactions, particularly key in supporting neurochemical production, mitochondrial health and fighting pro-oxidants and supporting antioxidants(Zheltova et al. 2016) Magnesium also supports neurtransmitter regulation, especially GABA (an inhibitory neurtransmitter). Deficientcy is common in those with ADHD and can excerbate symptons like irritability and attention difficulties. Supplementation with other compounds such as vitamin D have shown to significantly reduce behavioural problems  be effective (Hemamy et al. 2020). Other studies have shown magnesium to be effective with both zinc and omega 3 and 6 (Huss, Völp, and Stauss-Grabo 2010). 

Manganese is the essential cofactor for mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (SOD2/MnSOD), the primary superoxide-detoxifying enzyme in the mitochondrial matrix; manganese dysregulation is associated with cognition-related outcomes, serum Mn tends to be lower in Alzheimer’s disease in meta-analysis, while excess Mn exposure is linked to neurocognitive impairment (Du et al. 2017).

Zinc: Zinc is important for DNA synthesis, cell division, and neurotransmitter regulation, particularly in modulating dopamine—a key neurotransmitter implicated in ADHD. Higher doses are sometimes recommended (e.g., 15–30 mg), especially in those with absorption issues. Studies have shown benefits from higher doses of 30 mg in increasing BDNF(Agh et al. 2022). Improved efficacy of spreading vitamins through the day i.e. as b.i.d. dosing was found to be more effective for zinc glycinate(Arnold et al. 2011),(Akhondzadeh, Mohammadi, and Khademi 2004). 

Vitamin D: Vitamin D is crucial for brain development and cognitive function. It regulates neurotrophic factors, which are vital for the survival and growth of neurons, and modulates immune responses to reduce inflammation in the brain. It is highly prevalent for populations to have high levels of vitamin D deficiency and this is particularly important for those consuming vegetarian and vegan diets, where there is a low intake of animal-based vitamin D. One study looked at the modelling in dietary guidelines with a view to expediting the global acceptance of UV-exposed mushrooms as a source of vitamin D.(Starck et al. 2024).

Cobalamin (B12): is crucial role in its involvement in the conversion of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA , a key step in mitochondrial energy production. A deficiency in B12 can lead to a buildup of methylmalonic acid and odd-chain fatty acids, which are neurotoxic and contribute to myelin sheath damage. This disruption is linked to symptoms such as memory loss, brain fog, depression, and even early signs of dementia, vitamin B12 deficiency may even lead to dementia and psychosis, suggesting a broader dependence of the brain on B12, it is also commonly deficient in vegetarians (Pawlak et al. 2013).

Riboflavin (B2) supports mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and redox balance and methylation (see 3.2 above). Deficiency impairs amino acid oxidation and ATP production, and supplementation has been shown to elevate antioxidant enzyme levels, including glutathione reductase (Aragão et al. 2024).

Pantothenic acid (B5): Essential for CoA and PDH function, which are necessary for TCA cycle energy generation. Deficiency impairs fatty acid oxidation and ATP production, potentially affecting brain energy levels (Liu et al., 2017).

Lithium, While not currently deemed essential,  emerging evidence supports a physiological role for trace lithium in brain health. Best known for its psychiatric use in bipolar disorder(Lundberg et al. 2020) linked it to improvements in mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and telomere shortening. low-dose lithium is now being explored for its neuroprotective and regulatory roles at trace levels. A landmark  study (2025) (Aron et al. 2025)showed that lithium concentrations in the prefrontal cortex are significantly reduced in individuals with Alzheimer’s disease, with depletion correlating to tau hyperphosphorylation, synaptic loss, and microglial activation via GSK-3β dysregulation. Supplementation with microdoses of lithium orotate in mouse models reversed this pathology, reduced amyloid accumulation, and preserved cognitive performance without toxicity. Lithium’s inhibition of GSK-3β intersects with pathways involving dopamine signaling, BDNF expression, and mitochondrial resilience. While not currently standard in ADHD treatment some efficacy has been shown in RCTs(Dorrego et al. 2002), with obvious concerns of toxicity or poor medication management needing consideration its trace mineral status, especially in contexts of dietary or regional deficiency, warrants further investigation.

8.4 Inflammation and ROS
When the amount of anti-oxidants  generated is inadequate to offset the detrimental effects of hazardous reactive oxygen species ROS, oxidative stress arises. Increased oxidative stress has been linked to cellular damage, DNA repair system malfunction, and in turn mitochondrial dysfunction (MD)(Solleiro-Villavicencio and Rivas-Arancibia 2018a). 
High levels of can cause astrocytes and microglia to become activated; reactive astrocytes can release pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g.,ADHD associated biomarkers IL-6,  IL-1β, TNF-α (Chang et al. 2020a)), exacerbating inflammation and neuronal damage creating a vicious cycle (Solleiro-Villavicencio and Rivas-Arancibia 2018b) This vicious circle may increase the risk of ADHD pathogenesis. 


8.5 Key Compounds Supporting Mitochondrial Function
Several amino acid–derived nutrients such as creatine, taurine, carnitine carnosine, and other cofactors are integral to sustaining mitochondrial energy production, buffering oxidative stress, and preserving neuronal function. Evidence suggests they may mitigate mitochondrial dysfunction, a feature common to ADHD, depression, and combinations of coq10 and creatine increased neuroprotection in Parkinsons and Huntingttons(Yang et al. 2009). While omnivore diets naturally supply creatine, taurine, and carnosine, which may support mitochondrial and neuroprotective functions; vegan diets rely on endogenous synthesis which can be low for many [CITATION NEEDED: study on endogenous creatine synthesis rates in vegetarians/vegans].
Compound	Primary Function(s)	Key Evidence
Creatine	ATP recycling via the phosphocreatine system; supports high-energy demand in neurons	Supplementation improves cognitive performance in sleep-deprived adults (Avgerinos et al. 2018)(McMorris et al., 2007) and enhances mitochondrial energy buffering in neurodegenerative models (Andres et al., 2008).
Taurine	Osmoregulation, calcium handling, GABA modulation, mitochondrial membrane stabilisation	Taurine protects mitochondrial function under oxidative stress in neuronal cultures (Jangra et al. 2024)(Ripps & Shen, 2012) and modulates neuroinflammation.
Carnitine	Transports long-chain fatty acids into mitochondria for β-oxidation	Acetyl-L-carnitine improves mitochondrial bioenergetics and reduces depressive symptoms in RCTs (Nasca et al., 2018). plausible but unconfirmed adjunct with heterogeneous responses (possibly better in inattentive presentations)(Van Oudheusden and Scholte 2002). 

Carnosine	Antioxidant and pH buffer; protects mitochondrial enzymes from glycation	Carnosine has been shown to reduce oxidative damage and preserve mitochondrial enzyme activity in ageing models (Schön et al. 2019) 



Cascade 8.1 — Plant–animal balance for mitochondrial resilience.
 
6.1algal oil for DHA/EPA and targets foods providing essential brain supporting vitamins: D (UV-exposed mushrooms; fortified plant milks/yogurts),  B12 (fortified plant milks, nutritional yeast), and  B6(chickpeas, potatoes, bananas, whole grains, soy). When dietary targets aren’t met on a given day, fortified foods or supplements can help maintain coverage. This also applies to creatine, taurine, or CoQ10 and while some exogenous levels exist they are derived substantially  more from animal based sources.  All of these targets together can offer additional mitochondrial support and could secondarily benefit executive function (shown as a dotted hypothesis). Adequate coverage supports membrane lipid composition and mitochondrial cofactors, increases ATP availability under cognitive load, while promoting mitochondrial resilience and bioenergetics.



Cascade 8.2 — Antioxidant Networks & Redox Balance
[Vitamin C + Vitamin E + Polyphenols + Carotenoids ↑] → [Antioxidant regeneration ↑] → [Lipid peroxidation ↓ ; Neuronal oxidative stress ↓] → [Mitochondrial & synaptic integrity ↑]
(Packer et al., 1997; Vertuani et al., 2004)
Implication: Diverse antioxidants act synergistically, forming networks that protect neuronal membranes and mitochondrial function more effectively than single compounds.
Cascade 8.3 — Mineral Competition & Metal Detoxification
[Essential minerals (Ca²⁺, Zn²⁺, Fe²⁺) + polyphenols ↑] → [Toxic metal absorption ↓] → [Systemic & brain metal burden ↓] → [Oxidative stress ↓ ; Dopaminergic signaling preservation ↑]
(Zhai et al. 2015)(Zhai et al., 2015; Dufault et al., 2024)
Implication: Dietary minerals and chelating polyphenols can reduce the uptake and brain accumulation of heavy metals, mitigating oxidative and neurotransmission disruption.
While this section has focused on mitochondrial function within the brain, mitochondrial inefficiency in peripheral tissues also plays a crucial role in ADHD-related fatigue, metabolic dysregulation, and immune priming. These systemic features are addressed in Section 8. 

9	Metabolic Dysregulation and Neuroendocrine Stress Pathways: The HPA and ANS
Stress Circuitry and ADHD
Neuroendocrine and autonomic systems
The neuroendocrine and autonomic systems, together with the Enteric Nervous System (ENS), form a tightly interwoven network regulating stress responses, metabolism, and gut–brain communication ((Mohamed and Kobeissy 2024b)The hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis orchestrates cortisol rhythms and systemic stress signaling, while the autonomic nervous system (ANS) integrates sympathetic “fight-or-flight” activity with parasympathetic recovery pathways. Within this circuitry, the sympatho-adreno-medullary (SAM) axis represents the most immediate arm (Wadsworth et al. 2019), releasing adrenaline and noradrenaline within seconds of a stressor. These overlapping systems mediate key feedback loops between diet, inflammation, and brain function, and are highly responsive to circadian and nutritional inputs 

In ADHD, stress circuitry is often dysregulated. Children with sensory over-responsivity show prolonged sympathetic arousal and sustained cortisol elevations (Lane 2010) suggesting compounded dysregulation of SAM and HPA systems. Epidemiological findings link this to clinical fatigue: while ~20% of the general population report clinically relevant fatigue (Galland-Decker et al. 2019) the rate in ADHD is ~62% (Rogers et al. 2017) ADHD burnout may therefore arise from sustained sympathetic drive combined with blunted cortisol recovery, leading to chronic exhaustion. 
More recently, controlled studies have linked ADHD severity to gender-specific primitive reflex persistence: the asymmetric tonic neck reflex (ATNR) in girls and the symmetric tonic neck reflex (STNR) in boys, each associated with balance deficits (Bob et al. 2021)While empirical data in adults are scarce, these findings suggest that incomplete reflex integration may contribute to chronic sympathetic dominance, emotional dysregulation, sleep disturbance and even primitive gut makeup.
Cortisol and ADHD
Cortisol profiles in ADHD are frequently abnormal, including blunted cortisol awakening responses and flattened daily rhythms (Isaksson et al. 2012); (Chang et al. 2021)(Chang et al. 2020); (Jue et al. 2023). Genetic variation in HPA-axis regulators, including NR3C1 polymorphisms, further supports a heritable component to stress dysregulation (Fortier et al. 2013);(Carpena et al. 2022)). These hormonal irregularities can invoke many ADHD related symptoms such as poor resilience, amplified impulsivity and anxiety, and impaired decision-making.

Metabolic Overlaps Between ADHD and Systemic Dysfunction
While epidemiological studies(Di Girolamo et al. 2022) suggest the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in adults with ADHD (~10.8% under 60) does not exceed general population norms  , there is substantial evidence of mechanistic overlap. ADHD often co-occurs with obesity, insulin resistance, and dysglycemia with shared pathophysiological pathways include dopaminergic reward circuit impairment, HPA-axis disturbances, chronic low-grade inflammation, and oxidative stress (Marcelli et al. 2025) These pathways create reciprocal vulnerability: metabolic dysfunction amplifies ADHD symptoms, and ADHD behaviors and lifestyles (poor diet, stress reactivity, irregular sleep) worsen metabolic risk and ADHD symptoms.
Prenatal exposures further highlight the metabolic link. Maternal diabetes is associated with significantly increased ADHD risk in offspring, with meta-analyses estimating a 44% increase overall(Guo et al. 2020) and higher risk for pre-existing diabetes compared to gestational diabetes (Damtie et al. 2025) Chronic maternal hyperglycemia and inflammation during neurodevelopment likely underpin this effect (Wimberley et al. 2024). 
Insulin Dysregulation
ADHD and some other neuropsychiatric conditions (e.g., ASD, Bipolar and MDD) may represent a cluster of disorders influenced by brain-specific insulin dysregulation (Fanelli et al. 2022) (Fanelli et al., n.d.). Insulin plays a central role in brain function, modulating neurotransmitter balance, synaptic plasticity, and cellular energy metabolism. Beyond standard fasting glucose measures, continuous glucose monitoring (CGMs) offers novel insights into postprandial spikes and glycemic variability.
 Consumer-driven interest in glucose monitoring has expanded rapidly, fueled both by digital health startups such as Levels Health and by public science communicators like Jessie Inchauspé (‘Glucose Goddess’), whose popularization of ‘glucose hacks’ has reached millions, provides a growing body of real-world evidence on dietary strategies to blunt glucose excursions.. This trend reflects a growing demand for personalized nutrition guided by real-time glucose data, even though clinical trial evidence remains limited. As discussed above (Section X: Food Matrix), the constitution of foods, such as whole fruit versus juice, and the order of eating (vegetables → protein → carbohydrate) can meaningfully reduce glycemic variability.
Altered glucose uptake has been observed in ADHD, with PET studies showing reduced metabolism in prefrontal and striatal regions (Zametkin et al. 1990) . 
Added Sugars and Metabolic Dysfunction. 
Beyond circadian disruption (see Section 9), chronic consumption of added sugars, particularly fructose-containing sweeteners such as sucrose and high-fructose corn syrup, exerts unique metabolic stress. (Stanhope 2016) Randomised trials show sugar-sweetened beverage intake drives dose-dependent increases in visceral adiposity, dyslipidaemia, and insulin resistance, even independent of weight gain(Sampasa-Kanyinga et al. 2018). For ADHD populations already vulnerable to glucose variability and reward-driven eating, high sugar intake may compound both metabolic and neurocognitive dysregulation. As discussed above (Section 3 – Food Matrix) sugars delivered within whole foods such as fruit or dairy are buffered by fibre, polyphenols, and micronutrients, producing more stable glycaemic responses. 
Emerging alternatives such as allulose, stevia, and monk fruit extracts offer sweetness with negligible impact on glucose. In studies Allulose has been shown to reliably attenuates postprandial glycaemia in healthy humans, even at modest doses (5–10 g per meal)(Tani et al. 2023).

Adipose Tissues and metabolic load
Adipose tissue further links metabolic health with brain function. Dysfunctional visceral adipose depots release pro-inflammatory cytokines that cross the blood–brain barrier and disrupt neurotransmission (Marx et al. 2004) Nuclear receptors such as PPAR-α and PPAR-γ, which regulate fatty acid oxidation, insulin sensitivity, and adipokine release, are central to this process. Omega-3 fatty acids act as partial agonists of PPARs, promoting mitochondrial efficiency and anti-inflammatory signaling. Their activation shifts adipose tissue toward a metabolically protective phenotype, with downstream benefits for neuroimmune stability (Corona and Duchen 2016). 
Beyond adipose-derived cytokines, microbial lipopolysaccharides (LPS)(Mohammad and Thiemermann 2021) can enter systemic circulation through increased gut permeability, amplifying low-grade inflammation and impairing insulin sensitivity. Dietary polyphenols, prebiotic fibres, and lactobacilli strains have been shown to reduce LPS translocation and neutralize its inflammatory signaling, underscoring the microbiome’s role in HPA–ANS stability.
(Zelicha et al. 2022)The Green Mediterranean Diet study produced greater visceral adipose tissue (VAT) loss than MED or control (≈ −14.1% vs −6.0% vs −4.2%); VAT loss tracked with higher total plasma polyphenols and with the microbiome-derived markers urolithin A (via ellagitannins: walnuts/pommegranate) and hippuric acid Green tea catechins (e.g., EGCG, EGC) (. Proteomics suggest VAT reduction is accompanied by shifts in adiposity-related pathways. Parallel analyses (Pachter et al. 2024) showed MED/green-MED attenuated brain atrophy by ~50%, with glycemic control contributing to the neuroprotective signal, consistent with a polyphenol–fibre–microbiome synergy improving metabolic and brain aging phenotypes. 

Dietary and Nutrient Modulators of Stress and Metabolism
Dietary and lifestyle interventions provide multiple leverage points to buffer HPA–ANS dysregulation and metabolic strain.

Mindful Eating & Stress Reduction	Mindfulness practices, structured meals, relaxation techniques	Reduces cortisol, improves appetite regulation (Torske et al., 2024; Katterman et al., 2014)
Fasting Approaches	Time-restricted eating, fasting-mimicking diet	Improve insulin sensitivity, metabolic efficiency; excessive fasting may elevate cortisol and destabilize mood in stress-sensitive ADHD (Sutton et al., 2018; Rangan et al., 2022; Nakamura et al., 2016)
Table X Categories of Modulators for the HPA Axis & ANS
Specific Nutrient Modulators
Taurine is a sulfur-containing, semi-essential amino acid that occurs naturally in the body and plays a protective role in modulating inflammation and oxidative stress. Experimental studies suggest that taurine may prevent neurotoxicity, stabilize neurotransmitter balance, and support cognitive health (Md. Jakaria a, n.d.) (Md. Jakaria a, n.d.) It also exhibits adaptogenic properties by buffering the brain against chronic stress and regulating the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis, including reductions in cortisol. In animal models of ADHD, taurine supplementation has been linked to improvements in attention and hyperactivity, though equivalent human data are lacking. While humans can synthesise small amounts of taurine endogenously from the precursor cysteine, this capacity is limited, making dietary intake from meats, shellfish, and cysteine-rich foods (e.g., poultry, eggs, legumes) an important source (Wójcik et al. 2010)
Adenosine, an endogenous somnogen that accumulates during wakefulness, is a critical regulator of dopamine signaling, sleep homeostasis, inflammation, and neural plasticity. It is generated through the breakdown of ATP, and rising extracellular levels throughout the day create the sleep “pressure” necessary for restorative rest. Dysregulated adenosine signaling has been implicated in ADHD phenotypes, including inattention and hyperactivity (Valladão et al. 2024) (Valladão et al., 2024). Emerging evidence suggests that specific dietary compounds, such as green tea polyphenols, and adenosine-regulating nutrients including plant-based methyl donors (folate, choline, betaine), may influence adenosine metabolism, modulate HPA axis activity, and help restore neurotransmitter balance ((Md. Jakaria a, n.d.) (Jia et al. 2024). 
Summary
ADHD is marked by multi-system dysregulation that extends beyond neurotransmission to include stress circuitry, metabolic control, inflammation, and energy regulation. Dysfunctions in the HPA axis, ANS, and ENS amplify one another, creating feedback loops that worsen cognitive fatigue, emotional instability, and poor metabolic resilience. Shared pathways with metabolic disorders—insulin resistance, visceral adiposity, chronic inflammation, and oxidative stress—highlight ADHD as part of a broader spectrum of neuro-metabolic vulnerability. Emerging models emphasize that stress regulation is best understood through an allostatic lens, where heterogeneous and individual adaptations shape symptom patterns across disorders (Christensen et al. 2020) As the science evolves more frameworks will probably merge  and as interdependcies and synergies become clearer the dietary interventions and framework will need to evolve accordingly.

10	Circadian Rhythm Modulators, Chrono-Nutrition and Exercise, Sleep, Fasting.
Aligning nutrient intake with circadian and activity rhythms represents the science of chrono-nutrition which if followed can represent lower metabolic stress if we eat in line our biological clock. Failing to do so is associated with increased adiposity, T2DM, and cardiometabolic risk factors. Chrono-nutrition is based on three different dimensions of eating behavior, including timing, frequency, and regularity(Franzago et al. 2023). 
In ADHD, where appetite suppression from medications (Nancy Clark 2022) , irregular eating, and sleep disruption are common, timing nutrients appropriately may optimize energy regulation, neurotransmitter production and cognitive function. 
Circadian rhythms coordinate daily cycles in hormones, metabolism, and neurotransmitters. In ADHD, circadian disruption is common, including lower/shifted cortisol rhythms (Isaksson et al., 2012), delayed sleep phase and insomnia (Becker et al. 2019) , and genetic links between reduced nocturnal melatonin secretion and higher ADHD symptoms (Takahashi et al. 2024)
While zeitgebers refer to the primary external cues that synchronize our internal clocks, these are part of a broader category known as circadian modulators. Modulators include both these environmental signals and a wider array of internal influences that shape the strength, alignment, and expression of circadian rhythms. These may include specific nutrients, metabolic states, hormonal fluctuations, and even epigenetic changes such as methylation of circadian genes. 
In ADHD, circadian dysregulation is strikingly common. Flattened cortisol rhythms (Isaksson et al. 2012), delayed melatonin onset(Takahashi et al. 2024), and irregular sleep(Becker et al. 2019) are frequently reported, often correlating with attentional deficits and emotional lability  .

Modulator	Relevant Section	Primary Action on Circadian System
1.	Chrono-Nutrition	Neurochemical Rhythms and Chrono-Nutrition	Aligns food intake with neurotransmitter cycles (e.g., dopamine/serotonin) and peripheral clock genes.
2.	Fasting & Feeding Windows	Fasting, Feeding Windows, and Metabolic Regulators	Entrain AMPK/SIRT1 pathways; improves insulin sensitivity, mitochondrial function, and clock gene expression.
3.	Exercise	Exercise as a Circadian Regulator and Nutrient Synergy Amplifier	Resets peripheral clocks, enhances BDNF, neuroplasticity, glucose uptake, and amplifies nutrient effects.
4.	Sleep Hygiene	Sleep Health	Sleep timing both reflects and entrains circadian rhythm; poor sleep disrupts melatonin, cortisol, etc.
5.	Nutrient Synergy	Neurochemical Rhythms + Exercise Synergy + Sleep Health	Polyphenols, magnesium, omega-3s modulate clock gene expression and support neurotransmitter balance.
6.	Avoidances (Caffeine, Alcohol, etc.)	Lifestyle Strategies: What Not to Consume Near Bedtime	Caffeine delays melatonin; alcohol disrupts REM; sugar destabilizes insulin–melatonin cycles.
7.	Epigenetic Regulation	Epigenetic Influences and VIPR2	Circadian gene methylation (e.g., VIPR2) reflects long-term rhythm dysregulation; modifiable via diet.

Table 9 – Circadian Modulators for ADHD: Strategies and Mechanisms

9.1.1. Chrono-Nutrition (Neurochemical Rhythms )
This chrono-nutritional approach offers an additional lens through which to personalise dietary strategies for cognitive regulation, especially in neurodevelopmental conditions like ADHD.
Neurotransmitter activity follows circadian patterns that influence how the brain responds to nutrients. Dopamine and cortisol peak in the morning, supporting alertness and task initiation, while serotonin and melatonin rise in the evening, modulating mood, impulse control, and sleep(Huang et al. 2020). 
Earlier and more consistent eating windows are associated with improved weight and glycaemic outcomes )(Franzago et al. 2023)(J. Liu et al. 2023).  These benefits are partly explained by circadian biology in that adipose tissue insulin sensitivity is up to 54% higher at noon than at midnight(Poggiogalle et al. 2018). A practical approach that aligns with neurochemistry is to prioritise protein and tyrosine-rich breakfasts, coupled with some carbohydrate to minimise competition at the LAT1 transporter (see Section 4: Neurotransmitter Strategies;(Wurtman et al. 2003) thereby supporting daytime alertness. In contrast, reserving tryptophan with complex carbohydrates for the evening should facilitate serotonin and melatonin synthesis, supporting sleep physiology (This approach is grounded in circadian neurochemistry and nutrition mechanisms, though direct human outcome data remain limited). 

Phase	Dopamine	Norepinephrine	GABA	Key Strategy
Morning(Task initiation)	⬆️ Boost synthesis for motivation & focus	⬆️ Supports alertness, working memory	🔁 Still low to allow activation	• High-tyrosine protein (eggs, tofu, turkey)• B6, iron, vitamin C• Limit sugar and processed carbs
Mineral–electrolyte balance (Sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium)



Midday(Sustain cognition & emotion)	➖ Maintain steady release	➖ Regulate attention, prevent fatigue	⬆️ Light GABA tone helps reduce overstimulation	• Complex carbs + protein• Magnesium, zinc, B-complex• Leafy greens, seeds, legumes
Afternoon(Prevent crashes, emotional reactivity)	⬇️ Gentle taper	➖ Avoid overstimulation	⬆️ Increased GABA tone aids emotional balance	• Omega-3s, antioxidants• Polyphenols (berries, cocoa)• Avoid caffeine, simple sugars
Evening(Wind-down, sleep prep)	⬇️ Suppress for calm	⬇️ Lower arousal	⬆️ Strong GABA activation for sleep onset	• Tryptophan + complex carbs (pumpkin seeds + oats)• Magnesium, taurine, L-theanine• Herbal teas (e.g. chamomile(Kramer and Johnson 2024) for apigenin , lemon balm, tart cherry juice(Losso et al. 2018)f)

Table 8 - Circadian support of Neurotransmitters. 

9.1.2. Fasting, Feeding Windows, and Metabolic Regulators
Practical strategies like early eating, consistent meal windows, and time-restricted feeding show early success in improving metabolic and cognitive endpoints.  A meta-study found that in the context of an energy-reduced diet, distributing energy intake with a focus on earlier intake resulted in significantly greater weight loss (−1.23 kg; 95% CI 2.40, −0.06, p = 0.04). Improvements in HOMA-IR, fasting glucose, and LDL cholesterol were also seen.(Young et al)
Molecular evidence highlights SIRT1 and AMPK pathways as mediators of these effects, linking fasting cycles to mitochondrial efficiency, lipid metabolism, and reduced inflammatory signaling (Chang and Guarente 2014) Sahar & Sassone-Corsi, 2012). However, fasting can elevate cortisol and destabilize mood, particularly in stress-sensitive ADHD populations (Nakamura et al. 2016). While clinical trial data on fasting is limited, fasting has a high varied response so while feeding windows can be leveraged to improve metabolic control, moderation and personalization and close observation are critical; as well as consulting a healthcare professional or doctor. 
9.1.3	Exercise as a Circadian Regulator and Nutrient Synergy Amplifier
Exercise-aligned nutritional timing should be an integral component of all ADHD dietary plans. Physical activity triggers a cascade of neurochemical and metabolic shifts that enhance the brain's receptivity to specific nutrients, particularly those involved in neurotransmitter synthesis, mitochondrial function, and neuroplasticity. For example, post-exercise windows offer heightened sensitivity to glucose and amino acids, making it an ideal time to deliver precursors like tyrosine (dopamine), tryptophan (serotonin), magnesium, and omega-3s to support recovery and cognitive resilience. Moreover, exercise-induced BDNF surges can be potentiated by polyphenols(Davis et al. 2009) , DHA, and curcumin consumed within this window, suggesting a synergistic opportunity to enhance mood and learning consolidation. 
Physical activity, when aligned with circadian timing, not only entrains peripheral clocks but also enhances neuroplasticity, BDNF secretion, and mitochondrial efficiency, all of which are core to the BRAIN diet’s objectives. Strategic timing of exercise may therefore amplify the cognitive and metabolic benefits of the dietary protocol, particularly in populations with circadian disruption such as ADHD. 
Physical activity plays a crucial role in any ADHD dietary strategy, not only for its well-established benefits on mood and focus but also for how it shapes the body's metabolic and neurochemical environment. One study  (Youngstedt et al. 2019) mapped how the timing of exercise influences shifts in the circadian cycle , pecifically melatonin secretion rhythms. It found:
•	Phase advances (earlier rhythms) happened most strongly with exercise at 7:00 AM and between 1:00 – 4:00 PM. Earlier activity can therefore help counter the delayed phase seen in many with ADHD. 
•	Phase delays (later rhythms) occurred when exercise was done between 7:00 – 10:00 PM.
Exercise induces a cascade of physiological changes, such as increased blood flow, elevated BDNF (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor), improved insulin sensitivity, and enhanced mitochondrial activity, that temporarily heighten the brain’s receptivity to key nutrients.
These post-exercise windows present an optimal time to deliver nutrients critical to neurotransmitter synthesis and brain recovery. For example, amino acids like tyrosine and tryptophan, essential for dopamine and serotonin production respectively, are more efficiently utilized after physical exertion. Similarly, magnesium, omega-3 fatty acids, and B-vitamins—which support ATP production and neuronal signaling—can have amplified effects when timed alongside or following activity.
Moreover, exercise-induced BDNF surges can be synergistically potentiated by polyphenols (e.g., blueberries, green tea, Davis et al., 2009), DHA, and curcumin, all of which may enhance learning consolidation, synaptic growth, and emotional regulation. These interactions highlight the value of nutrition-exercise coupling as an underused therapeutic lever in ADHD management.
Timing also matters. Physical activity early in the day helps align circadian rhythms, regulate cortisol release, and entrain peripheral clocks, supporting improved sleep, appetite regulation, and metabolic stability—all frequently disrupted in ADHD. Many studies(Hashimoto et al. 2025) have proven the positive impact of movement immediately after glucose intake on postprandial glucose levels. This makes circadian-aligned exercise not only a metabolic tool, but a core component of the BRAIN diet’s strategy to restore homeostasis in neurodivergent populations.
9.1.4	Sleep Hygiene
Sleep is both an output of circadian rhythms and a critical zeitgeber in its own right, meaning that sleep timing not only reflects internal biological rhythms but also helps entrain them. In neurodevelopmental conditions like ADHD, where sleep architecture is frequently disrupted, targeting sleep through dietary, behavioural, and circadian strategies is vital for restoring homeostasis in an attempt to improve cognitive functions.
Sleep Dysregulation in ADHD
Individuals with ADHD often experience delayed sleep phase, onset insomnia, and hyperarousal, contributing to emotional volatility, fatigue, and poor attention regulation(Dolapoglu et al. 2025)(Takahashi et al. 2022). 
•	Evening melatonin secretion is often delayed, which may partly explain later bedtimes and longer sleep latency in ADHD populations. (Takahashi et al. 2024) indentified via GWAS Polygenic risk score (PRS) analyses showing genetic variants linked to lower nighttime melatonin secretion were associated with more severe ADHD symptoms, especially regarding inattention . The study also identified inflammatory pathways, particularly those involving interleukin-6 (IL 6), as common mechanistic links between melatonin regulation and ADHD symptomatology. 
•	Bright light in the morning and reduced evening blue-enriched light improve circadian entrainment and melatonin dynamics (Tähkämö et al. 2019) (Silvani et al. 2022) . 
•	Comorbid insomnia is a modulator of ADHD severity and common response to ADHD medication treatment. In one study insomnia was far more frequent among adults with ADHD (66.8%) than in the population controls (28.8%) (P < 0.001). Insomnia was more common in adults with the combined subtype than in those with the inattentive subtype (79.7% and 55.6%, respectively) (P = 0.003) (Brevik et al. 2017) .
•	Medication adverse reactions and sleep. With regards to medication meta analysis offer very mixed results; what is clear that consistent dosing is important to avoid any sleep irregularity. Large meta-analyses like (Becker et al. 2019) and (Cortese et al. 2009) reinforce that on average, stimulants tend to worsen sleep, whereas )(Brevik et al. 2017) found improvements, other research gives a mixed view depending on individuals existing insomnia before medication; in short it is highly nuanced and more research is needed, moreover expert clinicians are needed to titrate effectively to raise adherance which typically dips below 50% in adults after five years highlighting the need to a multimodal approach to ADHD (Charach et al. 2004).  It seems a consistent narrative that adverse reactions such as decreased appetite, sleep disturbances, headaches and stomachaches can be present in individuals that continue with medication. 
•	In a large registry sample(Nair et al. 2025) (n = 1,364), higher ADHD traits were associated with greater depression severity and lower quality of life, and this relationship was partly accounted for by insomnia and other sleep/circadian disturbances, highlighting sleep as a clinical target in ADHD.  If you want a These data strengthen the rationale for CBT-I, light timing, and caffeine curfews alongside chrono-nutrition to improve mood and daily functioning in ADHD.

9.1.5  Nutrient Strategies to Support Sleep Onset
Nutritional strategies that support sleep include evening meals rich in tryptophan and complex carbohydrates to promote melatonin synthesis, along with micronutrients such as magnesium and zinc known to improve sleep quality (Peuhkuri et al., 2012; Rondanelli et al., 2018). Evidence-based behavioral protocols such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) and strategic light exposure may also restore circadian alignment and improve sleep onset latency in ADHD (Corkum et al., 2020). Addressing sleep timing, quality, and duration is therefore essential in any chrono-nutritional protocol targeting brain health.

Certain foods and nutrients have been shown to support melatonin production, parasympathetic tone, and neurotransmitter balance conducive to sleep:
•	Tryptophan + complex carbohydrates: Aid serotonin conversion to melatonin; examples include pumpkin seeds + oats ⁵
•	Magnesium: Promotes GABAergic activity and muscle relaxation ⁶
•	Apigenin (from chamomile tea): Binds to benzodiazepine receptors, supporting calm and sleep ⁷
•	L-theanine: Found in green tea; increases alpha waves and calms without sedation ⁸
•	Tart cherry juice: Naturally rich in melatonin and shown to improve sleep duration ⁹

9.1.6	Avoidances - What not to Consume and when
 It is equally important to note what not to consume and when, even beneficial foods can be disruptive when mistimed. The lifestyle protocol to optimize neurotransmitters DOSE (dopamine, oxytocin, serotonin, and endorphins (Power 2025)  ) sets out the advantages of avoiding Caffeine, Alcohol and refined sugar.  While noting a  balanced consideration concerning coffee highlighting it’s ability to stimulate dopamine production(Volkow et al. 2015) while noting it’s pendulum effect between stimulation and it’s knock on effect of morning tiredness(O’Callaghan et al. 2018). 
•	Caffeine is an adenosine receptor antagonism it is a common recommendation to stop 8 hours before bed considering caffeine has a highly variable half-life, ranging from 2 to 10 h, but possibly up to 20 hours, depending upon individual tolerance. Evening caffeine delays melatonin onset in vivo, supporting an afternoon cut-off (Burke et al. 2015).  While Caffeine can reverse the deficits associated with fatigue it can be implicated in causing the fatigue in the first place. Late-day caffeine delays melatonin release and reduces sleep efficiency, while alcohol disrupts REM architecture and shifts circadian phase (Roehrs & Roth, 2001; Ehlers et al., 2019). So,  keeping tolerance low and more sparing, strategic use may be most effective for ADHD.
•	Alcohol is another somnogen which disrupts sleep architecture and circadian signaling(Thakkar et al. 2015). While it can shorten sleep latency and speed entry into deep  sleep, especially when taken in large amounts,  it also disrupts sleep homeostasis.  Alcohol suppresses REM sleep(Van Reen et al. 2011), especially in the first half of your sleep cycle, leading to a buildup of REM pressure that causes fragmented awakenings , increased arousals, and overall poorer sleep quality through the second half of a nights sleep. 
•	Simple sugar intake of sugar-sweetened beverages SSBs and energy drinks is linked with shorter sleep in adolescents; short sleepers had higher odds of consuming SSBs and nearly double the odds of energy drink use (Sampasa-Kanyinga et al. 2018). While an early high–glycemic index meal can shorten sleep onset by enhancing tryptophan availability for melatonin synthesis (Afaghi et al. 2007), this approach has limited clinical relevance. In everyday contexts, late consumption of simple sugars or ultra-processed foods is far more common and can provoke glucose fluctuations, reactive hypoglycaemia, and fragmented sleep, particularly in individuals with metabolic vulnerabilities. For individuals with ADHD, who already face irregular sleep and stimulant-related appetite shifts, evening sugar intake may be particularly disruptive while the connection to metabolic disorders is already a major concern for health; as discussed in Section 8 [Metabolic Dysregulation].

9.1.7 Epigentic influences and VIPR2 
Emerging epigenetic studies highlight that methylation of the VIPR2 gene, which encodes a receptor for vasoactive intestinal peptide involved in circadian rhythm regulation, may be linked to ADHD risk. Several clinical studies have reported altered VIPR2 methylation in children with ADHD, with sex-specific patterns: boys more often show hypomethylation, while girls show hypermethylation (Mooney et al. 2020). This difference could influence how ADHD or neurodevelopmental pathways are expressed differently in males and females, possibly explaining variations in symptoms, diagnosis rates, or even response to treatment. While these findings highlight a plausible mechanistic pathway through which diet and environment might exert influence, they remain hypothesis-generating rather than prescriptive.

Since DNA methylation patterns can be shaped by early-life exposures, including prenatal diet and metabolic stress (Guo et al. 2020), this underscores the importance of maternal nutrition, inflammation control, and circadian alignment during pregnancy as upstream modulators of neurodevelopmental trajectories (Rygiel et al. 2021) .

9.3 Summary	
With each biological system discussed in this paper, food must be viewed not as an arbitrary fuel source, but as a strategic modulator of function. More food is rarely the answer to biological dysfunction; even targeted nutrient boluses can have negative affects if repeated too frquently over time. This principle becomes especially clear in the context of circadian biology.
Beyond the central suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), circadian oscillators are now recognized in nearly all peripheral tissues, including the liver, gut, and retina, where they regulate local metabolic, hormonal, and redox cycles (Panda, 2007). Both caloric restriction and time-restricted feeding have been shown to reset central and peripheral clocks, enhancing the amplitude and coherence of clock gene expression in liver tissue, stabilizing body temperature rhythms, and modulating feeding behavior.
These adaptations may underlie many of the well-documented benefits of caloric restriction: improved mitochondrial efficiency, enhanced metabolic resilience, and even lifespan extension. More clinial trials are needed as most evidence is preclinical data but the research gives an insight into how such strategies  can support neuroplasticity, metabolic health, and healthy aging. 
10	Neuroprotective Herbal & Functional Foods

The herbal and functional foods are the final pillar in our neuroprotective and brain health diet. 


10.1 Culinary vs. Therapeutic Use of Herbs and Spices
Initial clinical trials that test the diet should emphasize the use of herbs and spices in culinary amounts, those typically found in traditional cuisines, rather than the high-dose medicinal levels often used in isolated clinical research. The core efficacy of the BRAIN Diet must rest on its integrated framework of precision dietary strategies, nutrient density, and food matrix interactions, rather than any one concentrated intervention. That said, future trials should explore therapeutic levels of specific spices or adaptogens (e.g. curcumin, saffron, gingerols) where targeted modulation of dysregulated biological systems is warranted.
10.2 Food synergies with spices for targeting dysregulated systems
There will be moments when individuals experience serious dysregulation in one biologic system, or more, and when the diet could be used to target certain systems or pathways i.e. increasing the inflammatory dietary targets such as certain spices, higher omega 3 and polyphenol combinations. In such instances raising targeted active ingredients towards therapeutic levels  might be beneficial if a medication model is not desired.  Many spices have been used in clinical trials against the core bio systems dysregulation that the BRAIN diets targets and many members of the Zingiberaceae family (which includes ginger, turmeric, and galangal) have pleiotropic effects overlapping between metabolic regulation and neurocognitive outcomes. By reducing inflammation and oxidative stress, these herbs and spices can modulate neurotransmitter production, improve mitochondrial function, potentially improving reducing anxiety, and improving cognitive performance. 
Herb/Spice	Primary Indication	Typical Dose/Form	Reference / Study Source
Saffron	ADHD symptoms, mood regulation	30 mg/day standardized extract (stigmas)	(Jackson et al. 2021; Lopresti and Drummond 2014)

Curcumin (Turmeric)	Anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective	500–1000 mg/day curcumin with piperine	Goozee et al., 2016; Rainey-Smith et al., 2022
Ginger	Gut-brain axis support, anti-inflammatory	1–2 g/day fresh or powdered root	Mashhadi et al., 2013; Sahebkar, 2013
Cinnamon	Glycemic control, insulin sensitivity, cognition	1–3 g/day cassia or Ceylon cinnamon powder	Anderson et al., 2004; Khan et al., 2003
Peppermint	Mental clarity, alertness	Herbal tea; essential oil inhalation	Moss et al., 2008; Kennedy et al., 2011
Sage	Memory and cognitive enhancement	200–400 mg/day extract or culinary doses	Tildesley et al., 2003; Kennedy et al., 2006
Rosemary	Focus, antioxidant, neuroprotective effects	Fresh herb or 250–500 mg/day extract	Pengelly et al., 2012; Moss & Oliver, 2012




Saffron - (it’s thought to boost serotonin and have antioxidant crocin and it has shown promising effects on depression(Lopresti and Drummond 2014),  mood, cognition(Jackson et al. 2021), and ADHD symptoms at doses around 30 mg/day of standardized extract ((Baziar et al. 2019)). While its distinct flavour and limited culinary uses make it impractical for routine dietary inclusion, it represents a compelling bioactive for future trials and adjunctive supplementation in neuro-supportive protocols. The delicate oils contained in saffron such as safranal and other volatile monoterpenes, are highly sensitive to heat, light, and oxidation. Bloom gently (≈50–70 °C) in a little warm water or fat, and add near the end of cooking to preserve their aroma and bioactive potency.

Curcumin - Systematic reviews affirm that curcumin supplementation can improve memory performance in older adults and enhance overall cognitive function in both healthy and at-risk populations . However, curcumin’s benefits may depend on
formulation due to its poor natural bioavailability, pairing with piperine will increase bioavailability upto 2000%(Shoba et al. 1998). 

Herbals and medication interactions

While culinary use of herbs and spices is generally safe, therapeutic doses may have potent biological effects and could interact with medications or underlying conditions. Any significant dietary changes or use of high-dose supplements should be made in consultation with a qualified healthcare professional.


Functional Foods
The target spices above, the polyphenols, the foods with good amino acid ratios, the friendly gut bacteria producing foods all form part of the functional food profile of the diet. Functional foods are broadly defined as “foods that provide health benefits beyond basic nutrition,” often by improving physiological functions or reducing disease risk. This includes naturally occurring foods like fatty fish or fermented dairy, as well as foods enhanced through modern innovation, such as sprouted grains, UV-grown mushrooms, or microencapsulated omega-3 oils. The FUFOSE (Functional Food Science in Europe) model laid early groundwork for this definition. However, the food's functional impact often depends upon it’s own matrix of physical structures and its components, it’s preparation and deliver system if it is processed(Yu et al. 2023) and the interactions between different foods consumed together, and how these collective effects influence digestion, absorption, metabolism, and ultimately physiological function. 
The BRAIN Diet embraces the functional food philosophy but deliberately moves away from reductionist interpretations that isolate nutrients from the broader biological and food matrix context. As we have highlight above omega 3 needs to bind to the correct phospholipids,  tryptophan will compete with other LEAAs unless carbohydrates create an insulin spike, turmeric is not just a curcumin supplement, it’s part of a culinary matrix that includes fats which with heat, can increase enhance curcumin’s absorption. 

11	Summary and Perspectives
This review paper comes at a prescient moment, when nutritional science is evolving rapidly. This dietary program and corpus of integrated science must now be further developed, also in support of other dietary programs which could be improved such as Keto or FMD etc. 
The dietary program must be continuously tested and developed at scale across institutions where targeted precision nutrition programs can really benefit individuals: schools, hospitals, prisons, elder care, and corporate environments. Only then will we see a systemic shift towards nutritional plans which support brain health and metabolic wellness. 
To summarise:
1. Food Matrix & Precision Nutrition
•	Understanding food matrix interactions is central to precision nutrition.
•	Leveraging this science can help correct dysregulated biological systems targeted by the BRAIN Diet, with implications for ADHD, cognitive health, metabolic health, and neurodegenerative disease risk.
•	Future research must expand laboratory studies into food matrix interactions and adopt FAIR data principles to accelerate open collaboration.
2. Personalization & Diagnostics
•	Diagnostic tools can guide personalization.
o	Food sensitivity testing (IgG/IgA, elimination protocols) can uncover immune or behavioral triggers.
o	Genetic SNP testing for ADHD participants can include core variants (MTHFR, COMT, BDNF Val66Met) alongside broader modulatory SNPs (CLOCK, PER3, FADS1/2, APOE4) that shape circadian rhythm, lipid metabolism, and dietary response.

.
4. Accessibility & Practical Application
•	Adherence is about sustainable patterns, not perfection.
•	Algorithms guiding weekly menus will be openly published and AI-assisted.
•	Leaning on plant proteins improves affordability and reduces health risks linked to excess red meat.
5. Nutrient Sufficiency Across Diet Types
•	Certain neuroprotective nutrients (e.g., creatine, taurine, carnitine) are abundant in animal foods.
•	Trials offering both omnivorous and plant-based versions will clarify whether observed benefits stem from animal-derived nutrients or compensatory advantages of plant-based diets (e.g., lower inflammation).
6. Functional Foods & Innovation
•	Functional foods (e.g., sprouted grains, functional breads, probiotic dairy, UV-grown mushrooms, functional ice creams) fit within a systems framework, not as isolated solutions.
•	Emerging technologies (microencapsulation, precision fermentation, biofortification) offer delivery advantages but must complement, not replace, diverse whole-food patterns.
7. Broader Health & Societal Impact
•	Since the systems addressed overlap with cardiovascular and metabolic health, the BRAIN Diet also supports healthy ageing and lifespan.
•	Implementation at scale across schools, hospitals, prisons, elder care, and workplaces could drive systemic change in mental and metabolic wellness.
8. Call for Open Collaboration
•	Nutrition science must move beyond publication into shared, open knowledge that is integrated into practice.
•	The BRAIN Diet can serve as a vehicle for collaboration across microbiome research, neuronutrition, metabolic health, and food science.
•	Clinical trials and deeper research into the food matrix remain essential. Many of the biological mechanisms discussed below, such as gut microbiome composition, gut-brain axis dynamics, and neurotransmitter regulation, are still emerging fields. They require further exploration through larger, more nuanced human studies to strengthen their clinical relevance, but some positive human studies exist and much preclinical research indicates dietary interventions could be highly  beneficial (Ciancarelli 2024). 

As Ferran Adrià noted in the 2014 foreword to Nathan Myhrvold’s Modernist Cuisine series, “Now is a good time to rethink how we teach cooking in schools… this lays a steppingstone to the future of cooking.” A decade later food education has not advanced but science continually does. As advances in microbiome research, neuro-nutrition, metabolic health, genomics, and food science continue to accelerate, these fields must converge into a cohesive whole. If we can raise nutritional literacy and embed this knowledge into culture, we may begin to reverse the parallel epidemics of mental illness and metabolic disease, while reducing the symptons, and in some cases the causes, of health conditions. The BRAIN Diet offers one such vehicle to help shift towards such a paradigm but much more work will be required before truly implementable systems are in place.  
Despite often being dismissed as a childhood attention issue, ADHD is now recognised as a systemic, frequently lifelong condition with significant health risks and reduced life expectancy. It is not solely a cognitive or behavioural disorder, but increasingly understood as a condition cyclically linked to deep physiological dysregulation, underpinned by genetic predispositions and epigenetic modifications. With modelled life expectancy reductions of up to 8.4 years in men and 5.8 years in women, this represents an additional burden for individuals with ADHD to carry.
We must adopt a paradigm of food as medicine, where nutrition is regarded as a clinical-grade intervention, with provenance and production held to the highest standards. If we are to shift the health trajectory of those with ADHD, we must move beyond symptom suppression and begin addressing the root causes of biosystem dysfunction, inflammation, neuroendocrine stress and metabolic overload. Such an approach holds the potential not only to improve cognitive function in the short term, but also to foster long-term physiological resilience and extend healthspan in neurodivergent populations, ensuring that individuals with ADHD can thrive across the lifespan.

2.	Micronutrient Absorption
We note some are key considerations such as the vitamin and mineral synergies which need to be factored into the diet to support brain health: 
Vitamin C, - significantly improves non-heme iron absorption by reducing ferric to ferrous iron, with studies showing up to a fourfold increase when consumed together (Hallberg et al., 1989).
Vitamins A, D, E and K -  Dietary fat enhances the absorption of these fat-soluble vitamins (Tangpricha et al., 2003), 
Zinc and magnesium – will competete and high-dose supplementation has been observed to reduce absorption efficiency, warranting staggered intake when clinically necessary (Arnaud, 2008). 
Proper preparation techniques — such as soaking, fermenting, sprouting, or cooking — dramatically reduce the levels of problematic compounds while preserving or enhancing the bioavailability of beneficial nutrients., making them less of a blanket concern and more a question of dietary context. Similarly, tannins and saponins may inhibit nutrient uptake but also have anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and anti-carcinogenic effects.
From a brain health perspective, the primary concerns are antinutrients that significantly impair the availability of iron, zinc, magnesium, and B vitamins—nutrients critical for neurotransmitter synthesis, myelination, and mitochondrial function. For individuals with ADHD or cognitive impairments, diets overly reliant on high-phytate or high-oxalate foods without preparation methods like soaking, fermenting, or boiling could exacerbate mineral imbalances. However, when traditional preparation techniques are used, the potential downsides of antinutrients are largely mitigated allowing their possible protective and regulatory roles to be retained without compromising brain-supportive nutrition.
Cooking and Preparation methods to reduce oxidants and antinutrients
Alongside nutrient pairing, cooking methods and fat choices play a crucial role in the nutritional quality of meals. While it is commonly held that steaming, baking, or light sautéing helps maintain nutrient density and antioxidant content, sometimes larger benefits maybe gained from boiling i.e. reducing oxalates and phytates in green vegetables such as spinach and kale (Chai and Liebman 2005). 

Because the BRAIN diet specifically targets leafy green vegetables i.e. kale and spinich that are rich in iron, magnesium, and zinc this can introduce high dietary oxalate. Oxalate binds to these minerals and forms insoluble compounds, which significantly reduces their bioavailability, (Chaiyarit and Thongboonkerd 2020)also found that oxalate (CaOx crystals and NaOx) negatively affects mitochondrial function and changes redox status in monocytes while also affecting mitochondrial function. 

While concerns that oxalate causes stones is often inflated,  as only about 10% of people  will ever develop these in their lives(with 80% of those being oxolate crystal related), and only about 2% of people  are oxalate sensitive,  the diet should feature meals that reduce the absorption of oxalate and support the good foundational gut bacteria which help process oxalate(Daniel et al. 2021). 
 
Highly processed seed oils, such as soybean, sunflower, and corn oil, are high in omega-6 fatty acids, which are unstable at high temperatures and proinflammatory. When heated, these oils undergo oxidation, producing harmful lipid peroxides and advanced glycation end products (AGEs)(Uribarri et al. 2010) These compounds act as local initiators of inflammation, triggering cellular signaling pathways that increase production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6). Elevated IL-6 c activates microglia, the brain’s immune cells, leading to a state of neuroinflammation. This process has been implicated in altering neurotransmitter function, synaptic plasticity, and dopaminergic signaling ((Ramsden et al. 2013);(Schwingshackl and Hoffmann 2014)). 

Replacing industrial seed oils with more stable options like olive oil, ghee, or avocado oil, especially for low- to medium-heat cooking, may reduce inflammatory load while preserving beneficial polyphenols. The strategy of simply adding parsley when cooking food has seen significant reductions in harmful COPs (Cholesterol Oxidation Products) (de Oliveira et al. 2022).
Soaking strategies to reduce phytates
 
Table X – Summary of Current and Topical Food Preparation & Interaction Strategies Relevant to Brain Health


Besides cooking techniques, preparation techniques can also maximise nutrients and reduce negative food content and synergy effects.  Soaking and sprouting grains is one such method to increase the bioavailability of iron by reducing phytates, the germination of grains increases antioxidant and nutritional value also. (Luo and Xie 2014) . Just soaking beans at the right temperature and pH level can activate endogenous phytases reducing the phytate content ‘Optimal conditions for the endogenous phytases of black beans, is 60C and pH 6.0,that resulted in a 55% reduction in 1P6 after soaking and cooking. (GREINER and KONIETZNY 1999). 

Step	How	Why It Helps
1. Rinse and soak beans	Soak dried beans in filtered warm water (~50–60°C, or ~120–140°F) for 12–24 hours. Keep warm in a thermos or low oven.	Activates natural phytase enzymes in the beans
2. Add a mild acid (optional but helpful)	Add a bit of lemon juice or apple cider vinegar (1–2 tsp per liter of water) to reach ~pH 5.5–6.	Optimizes pH for phytase enzyme activity
3. Replace soaking water	After soaking, discard the water, rinse beans well.	Removes dissolved phytates and anti-nutrients
4. Cook thoroughly	Boil the beans in fresh water until soft. Do not use soaking water for cooking.	Heat completes the breakdown of residual phytates
5. Pair with vitamin C	Eat your beans with vitamin C-rich foods (e.g., tomatoes, peppers, citrus)	Vitamin C enhances non-heme iron absorption even in the presence of phytates

Bread and Food Matrix effects example
Bread making is an example of how food preparation strategies can have a positive effect on the reduction of harmful cooking bi-products and the introduction of good bi-products. (Coda, Rizzello, and Gobbetti 2010) demonstrate the fermentation of quinoa flour, and other functional flours, introduces natural GABA; also with the addition of Glycine, a common industrial practice, harmful acrylamide can also be reduced (Fink et al. 2006). Proteolytic events that occur during sourdough fermentation affect the overall quality of bread, this process sees the sourdough fermentation enhances bioavailability of amino acids through activation of endogenous cereal proteases under acidic conditions(Gänzle, Loponen, and Gobbetti 2008), and in some cases, microbial proteases from lactic acid bacteria. This enzymatic activity is also associated with increased digestibility and reduced immunogenicity of gluten peptides. By considering the synergy of ingredients, the optimal application of time and heat, and the details within the cooking i.e. closed cooking pot i.e. dutch oven opposed to open oven; the end product will reap several synergistic health benefits ( Table 11 below).

Component / Step	Purpose / Action	Effect on MRP / Acrylamide / Antioxidants/Health
Whole Spelt Flour	-High asparagine + fibre; substrate for Maillard; better MRPs than white flour	↑ Melanoidin precursors; ↑ antioxidant MRPs
Whole Wheat Flour	-Gluten strength; more amino acids to fuel Maillard reaction	↑ Free amino acids; balanced reaction profile
Pseudo Grains	Quinoa, amaranth etc can introduce GABA and other important brain nutrients	↑ increase GABA and vitamins and minerals
Glycine (0.3–0.4%)	-Reduces acrylamide by competing with asparagine; encourages safer browning	↓ Acrylamide formation; redirects Maillard toward safer end-products
Sourdough Starter (100% hydration)	-Introduces Lactic Acid Bacteria LAB which degrades asparagine; lowering acrylamide risk. 
-Increases SCFA precursors + microbial diversity, 
-Slower starch breakdown,
 supports glucose metabolism	↓ Asparagine via enzymatic degradation; gut microbiome support,
 ↓ Phytates broken down, especially in whole grains
↓ Lowers glycemic impact


Honey or Malt Syrup (small amt)	-Provides reducing sugars for Maillard; moderate dose helps antioxidant MRP formation	↑ Maillard activity in balance; enhances melanoidin production
Sea Salt	-Flavor + essential minerals; may slightly influence water activity	Neutral; supports flavor and mineral profile
Filtered Water (72–76% hydration)	-Supports Maillard without over-drying crust; helps suppress acrylamide	↑ Moisture retention = ↓ crust acrylamide; ↑ safe Maillard reaction
Cold Fermentation (~12–18h)	-Releases free amino acids; promotes natural proteolysis; lowers asparagine	↑ MRP diversity; ↓ acrylamide via extended fermentation
Dutch Oven Baking (Enclosed)	-Steam traps moisture; reduces crust temperature; slows acrylamide formation	↓ Acrylamide; ↑ antioxidant MRPs; gentle crust formation
Bake Temp (230°C → 210°C)	-Optimized heat curve for melanoidin formation; avoids excess acrylamide	↑ Browning compounds (melanoidins); ↓ harmful byproducts from excessive heat
Final Crust (Golden Brown)	-Promotes Maillard without carbonisation; visible indicator of antioxidant peak	Ideal MRP formation; acrylamide minimized via color monitoring

Proteins, muscle mass and Longevity 
A meta study(Naghshi et al. 2020) found that intake of total protein was associated with a lower risk of all cause mortality, and intake of plant protein was associated with a lower risk of all cause and cardiovascular disease mortality, their study found that increasing the amount of plant proteins by 3% of energy from plant proteins a day was associated with a 5% lower risk of death from all causes. (Sun et al. 2019) found that by increasing 5% energy from animal protein with plant protein was associated with a 13% lower risk of all-cause mortality, while substituting a four ounce equivalent/day of total red meat with poultry, fish/shellfish, or nuts, was associated with a 8%, a 12%, and a 12% lower risk of all-cause mortality, respectively.
While there are mixed results relating to the value of higher amounts of protein in health and longevity, there are clearer positive signals to the correlation of muscle mass and longevity (Srikanthan and Karlamangla 2014) and the associated health benefits, and longevity associated with the reduction of sarcopenia(Coelho-Junior et al. 2022) and higher protein and exercise in combatting anabolic resistance(Tezze, Sandri, and Tessari 2023) . Older adults may require higher protein intake to prevent sarcopenia and functional decline (Houston et al. 2008) found that over 3 years the highest quintile on approximately 1.1 g/kg/day of protein per day over the lowest quintile: approximately 0.7 g/kg/day experienced a 40% less loss of lean mass.

Sustainability
Importantly, a well-formulated vegan BRAIN Diet may offer distinct advantages in terms of environmental sustainability, especially when grounded in regenerative agriculture and a wide diversity of minimally processed plant foods. However, it is a misconception that all vegan foods are inherently low-impact, factors such as processing intensity, long-distance transport, and monoculture cropping must also be weighed, though whole foods are the focus; sometimes protein isolates and ….maybe necessary to create full food matrix synergies within meals. 
Equally, the omnivore version of the BRAIN Diet is intentionally designed to be plant-forward, emphasizing seasonal produce, legumes, whole grains, nuts, and fermented foods, while using small amounts of high-impact animal products (e.g., organ meats, shellfish, eggs, or oily fish) for their nutritional density. This approach not only minimizes ecological footprint per nutrient delivered, but also aligns with principles of nutritional efficiency and dietary restraint, which are central to sustainable food systems. In both cases—vegan or omnivore—closing the nutrient gap is not simply about substitution, but about elevation: selecting high-function, bioactive-rich foods that can meet complex neurobiological demands. When done strategically, brain health and environmental stewardship can coexist without compromise.
Aspect	Vegan BRAIN Diet	Omnivore BRAIN Diet
Core Focus	100% plant-based; relies on high-function, nutrient-dense whole foods	Primarily plant-based with targeted use of nutrient-dense animal foods
Protein Sources	Legumes, fermented soy, lupins, Mankai, seeds, whole grains, functional yeasts	Same as vegan + small amounts of shellfish, organ meats, pasture-raised eggs
Animal Products	None	Ethically sourced, high-nutrient-density options (e.g., liver, fish roe, sardines)
Supplementation Needs	Likely includes B12, DHA (from algae), possibly iron, zinc, creatine, coQ10	Possibly lower; B12, DHA, choline, creatine often obtained from food. Probable benefits in omega 3 daily or minimum x3 upto 2mg per week. 
Environmental Impact	Lower greenhouse gas emissions overall—but varies by crop source & processing	Moderately higher footprint but offset by minimal use of high-impact animal foods
Food Sourcing	Regenerative, seasonal, low-processed plant foods preferred	Regenerative farming for animal inputs; nose-to-tail (offal sources having the highest nutrient levels in animal products (Latoch, Stasiak, and Siczek 2024)) and low-waste ethos encouraged

Sustainability Trade-offs	Risk of relying on ultra-processed vegan substitutes or monoculture crops	Risk of higher footprint if animal foods are overused or poorly sourced
Best Practice Goal	Maximize nutrient density via functional plants + strategic supplementation	Optimize nutrient delivery with minimal, strategic animal intake
